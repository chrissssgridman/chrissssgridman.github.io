    <p class="boxed">this isn't exactly done yet! i still have a few more things to add here... have fun with what's there though</p>

    <h1>wallpapers</h1>
    <h2>nichijou no gaiden</h2>
    <p>somewhat dated wallpapers, but i'm sure you'll get something out of it. was probably one of the reasons why the project never happened.</p>
    <table width="100%">
        <th>
            <img src="../downloadables/wallpapers/nng/nichijougaidenwallpaper62518.png" width="625px"><br>one of the handful of wallpapers

            <th><a href="../downloadables/wallpapers/nng/nng.zip"><img src="../images/misc/downloadables/website-downloadbutton.gif"></a></th>
        </th>
    </table>

    <h2>aseprite work</h2>
    <p>this here is a collection of my wallpapers made in aseprite, this includes a variety of wallpapers! i would say this is the better fof the bunch.</p>
    <table width="100%">
        <th>
            <img src="../downloadables/wallpapers/aseprite/rikowallpaper.png" width="625px"><br>my favorite

            <th><a href="../downloadables/wallpapers/aseprite/aseprite.zip"><img src="../images/misc/downloadables/website-downloadbutton.gif"></a></th>
        </th>
    </table>

    <h2>moshed</h2>
    <p>moshed is a website that allows you to fuck up and glitch images! i used some filters and made some cool stuff. here's those wallpapers (they're pretty small res though)</p>
    <table width="100%">
        <th>
            <img src="../downloadables/wallpapers/moshed/klaust_mm-newbg.png" width="625px"><br>

            <th><a href="../downloadables/wallpapers/moshed/moshed.zip"><img src="../images/misc/downloadables/website-downloadbutton.gif"></a></th>
        </th>
    </table>

    <h1>sticky cursors</h1>
    <p>originally made sometime in 2015 to 2016 while i was working on my scratch account, this is a pack of cursors made by my younger and far less talented self. please do not actually use this as your default mouse, for the love of god. it's not worth it. the pointer isn't even in the right position perpendicular to the actual pointer. it's that bad.</p>
    <table width="100%">
        <th><img src="../images/misc/downloadables/image_26.png"><br>what it's gonna look like on your desktop</td>
        <th><img src="../images/misc/downloadables/image_27.png">
        <br>preview of every cursor file (none of them are animated!)</th>

        <th><a href="../downloadables/sticky cursors.zip"><img src="../images/misc/downloadables/website-downloadbutton.gif"></a></th>
    </table>

    <h1>marblesquared</h1>
    <p>a collection of algodoo schematics made for easier construction of marble races. i don't have screenshots of them right now but it is what it is! you'll need algodoo in order to use this obviously. also contains a <code>README.txt</code> for whatever reason</p>
