        <br>
        additionally, due to the large file sizes of some of these, the downloads links (now) send you to a google drive link in which you can download all the files from there. infinite data for the win my MAN. thanks google

    <h1>sticky cursors</h1>
    <p>originally made sometime in 2015 to 2016 while i was working on my scratch account, this is a pack of cursors made by my younger and far less talented self. please do not actually use this as your default mouse, for the love of god. it's not worth it. the pointer isn't even in the right position perpendicular to the actual pointer. it's that bad.</p>

    <h1>marblesquared</h1>
    <p>a collection of algodoo schematics made for easier construction of marble races. i don't have screenshots of them right now but it is what it is! you'll need algodoo in order to use this obviously. also contains a <code>README.txt</code> for whatever reason</p>

    <h1>scratchxt archive</h1>
    <p>scratchxt is the name of my old 2014 account on the kid's coding site, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch</a>. my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ScratchXT">own profile</a> is something that i find to be a collection of old artifacts from my past, some of which i barely remember at all! yeah, this is where the origins all came into play. i met friends there, got my absolutely shit comedic taste, and also got into objects and madness combat during these years. i was never innocent. i hope you enjoy this huge archive as much as i enjoyed (mostly) making these projects, most of which aren't of my own original work.</p>
    <table width="100%">
    <td><p class="boxed">
        <b>IMPORTANT:</b>
        <br>
        every file by the file type of <code>.sb3</code> requires the official scratch offline player to be downloaded in order to open them. additionally, you can also load them onto the website itself, but to prevent any accidental copies being shared publicly onto the site (since they already exist on my own profile), it's best to just use the offline editor, located <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/download">here</a>.
        <br>
        additionally, due to how amazingly large the archive is (even in an unfinished state), all the files are on a google drive link for you to download at any time. having the .zip file roam around here would be far too big for the website. the hard limit is 100GB anyways, and if i were to stay like this i don't think i would ever reach the limit. it would probably require tens of thousands of images and many, many blog posts. however, that would be much smaller in amount if i were to keep the huge ass archive around. anyways, here you go!
