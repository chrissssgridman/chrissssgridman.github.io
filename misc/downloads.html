<h2>sticky cursors</h2>
<p>a very old cursor pack from a few years ago back during the scratch days. all images were made in the scratch editor and compiled only now into a usable cursor pac. i don't know why you would want to use these at all, but the option's there if you want to.</p>

<h2>marblesquared 1.2 beta</h2>
<p>marblesquared was a project in regard to algodoo marble races. for those who don't know, algodoo is a 2d physics sandbox, and can be used for a variety of physics-related situations, some of which do include marble races. marblesquared was going to take a more modular approach to the race, allowing different pieces to be connected together.</p>
