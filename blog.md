### september
#### day 8 | back and forth
##### 5:50 pm
well, it was a painful process just trying to find what jekyll themes will work. turns out, none of them did! i guess it's just so *broken* and whatnot it just **won't** work with what i got.

for now, if any of you guys want a dark theme, use a browser extension or whatever. that should do the job.

#### day 9 | the day all hope was taken from us
##### 10:29 AM
as i'm typing this entry in atom, it appears that my internet **went down** without any warning. looks like i'll have to occupy my own time for the supposed downtime.

well, i guess i can just, go and type whatever i want for a few hours? not gonna lie, that'll just be a bunch of me ranting about crap. seriously, have you guys ever *seen* what i can do sometimes? i even made an n++ level that has like 2 rotating lasers in it and only me and one other guy managed to beat it. i suspected that he looked at the replay. you always think they're gonna do it different, but nope they do it almost exactly as you do
