## 2018
### september
#### day 8 | back and forth
##### 5:50 pm
well, it was a painful process just trying to find what jekyll themes will work. turns out, none of them did! i guess it's just so *broken* and whatnot it just **won't** work with what i got.

for now, if any of you guys want a dark theme, use a browser extension or whatever. that should do the job.

#### day 9 | the day all hope was taken from us
##### 10:29 AM
as i'm typing this entry in atom, it appears that my internet **went down** without any warning. looks like i'll have to occupy my own time for the supposed downtime.

well, i guess i can just, go and type whatever i want for a few hours? not gonna lie, that'll just be a bunch of me ranting about crap. seriously, have you guys ever *seen* what i can do sometimes? i even made an n++ level that has like 2 rotating lasers in it and only me and one other guy managed to beat it. i suspected that he looked at the replay. you always think they're gonna do it different, but nope they do it almost exactly as you do

##### 10:32 AM
do we have a table of contents feature available or is that what those blue link things on all my headers are for?

##### 10:33 AM
forgot to mention that i finally got that dark theme browser extension, so my website is now in beautiful dark colors! that's, like, cool and stuff.

moving on, it's more or less that the internet will probably be back up by when the clock hits PM. i dont know what *pm* actually stands for but i'm having my thoughts it's any of these options

* past morning
* past morning
* pre-morning just kidding it's past morning
* **past morning**

if i ramble on for too long i'll have it so that all my paragraphs are sliced per 30 mins, so the next sorta heading will arrive to this `blog.md` document at 1:03 PM or something

##### 10:38 AM
so i've added a new images folder, i'll probably be posting imagery soon, that is! problem is that first i have to upload the image here, use some `.md` supported format, and i have no idea if it's *actually* going to work all at once. i'm saying we have a 50/50 chance over here.

i'm gonna go get something to eat i was drinking pepsi brand root beer for a while
