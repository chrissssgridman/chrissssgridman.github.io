<p><b>Your name is Rikotsura. It's been a while since you've moved to this house after your past, and the outside isn't worth it. Not anymore. Alas, the memories of the past still bother you, and there's not much you can do about it besides sleep it over. Maybe you'll forget this had ever happened.</b></p>

<p>klaust_ is developed using RPG Maker 2003 and Aseprite. Development is normally done privately, and no release date is set. It will be available when it is done. The most likely mirrors will be Gamejolt, Miroware Pipe, Google Drive, and GitHub. This has been chipped away at for a while now, and I do hope you get to try it out sometime.</p>
<p>Any related wallpapers to the game are available under the wallpapers download linked at the <a href="/misc/downloads.html">downloads page</a>.</p>
