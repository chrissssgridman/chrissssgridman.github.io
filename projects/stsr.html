<b>spencer! the show! reboot</b> (or <b>s!ts!r</b>) is a show created by spencer everly in which spencer, sherbert, and lewbert do the funny over in futuristic central city, a city that of which looks nothing like a futuristic city. at all. the reason why i'm even including this ms paint/adobe animate show in my list of projects is that i actually wrote some parts of an episode for it, including a few scenes from the movie that (as of this time (11/1/19) he still hasn't finished) mostly got cut, but hey i was told there'd be a director's cut version so that's always nice
