<br>

<b>rwby house</b> is a parody of khonjin house that uses characters from the rooster teeth show rwby. i do the animation and i find whoever the fuck in regards to voice acting. episodes are released whenever and is merely a side project if i don't have anything else to do that i'm currently interested in.
<br>
<br>
the show revolves around neo, one of the villains that show up in later volumes/seasons of rwby but for future episodes i plan on the actual main 4 instead of these random other characters that aren't in actual groups in the original show. there's also a lot of differences with character personalities so don't expect anything to be correct from the show, like, at all
<br>
<br>
if you wanna help voice act stuff then you can go and message me about it. if you also want to submit episodes then just send me a script and i'll see if i can include it. note that the show is most CERTAINLY ironic so there's no WEIRD PLOT SHENANIGANS under the hood. daz bout' et
