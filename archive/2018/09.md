# september 2018
## day 8 | back and forth
### 5:50 PM
well, it was a painful process just trying to find what jekyll themes will work. turns out, none of them did! i guess it's just so *broken* and whatnot it just **won't** work with what i got.

for now, if any of you guys want a dark theme, use a browser extension or whatever. that should do the job.

## day 9 | the 450% late internet-free finobe r/nichijou groupwatch marathon spectacular++
### 10:29 AM
as i'm typing this entry in atom, it appears that my internet **went down** without any warning. looks like i'll have to occupy my own time for the supposed downtime.

well, i guess i can just, go and type whatever i want for a few hours? not gonna lie, that'll just be a bunch of me ranting about crap. seriously, have you guys ever *seen* what i can do sometimes? i even made an n++ level that has like 2 rotating lasers in it and only me and one other guy managed to beat it. i suspected that he looked at the replay. you always think they're gonna do it different, but nope they do it almost exactly as you do

### 10:32 AM
do we have a table of contents feature available or is that what those blue link things on all my headers are for?

### 10:33 AM
forgot to mention that i finally got that dark theme browser extension, so my website is now in beautiful dark colors! that's, like, cool and stuff.

moving on, it's more or less that the internet will probably be back up by when the clock hits PM. i dont know what *pm* actually stands for but i'm having my thoughts it's any of these options

* past morning
* past morning
* pre-morning just kidding it's past morning
* **past morning**

if i ramble on for too long i'll have it so that all my paragraphs are sliced per 30 mins, so the next sorta heading will arrive to this `blog.md` document at 1:03 PM or something

### 10:38 AM
so i've added a new images folder, i'll probably be posting imagery soon, that is! problem is that first i have to upload the image here, use some `.md` supported format, and i have no idea if it's *actually* going to work all at once. i'm saying we have a 50/50 chance over here.

i'm gonna go get something to eat i was drinking pepsi brand root beer for a while

### 10:42 AM
ok so all that was there were some expired froot loops probably and stuff that *isn't* food. there's probably like an apple in the fridge but i'm not risking cutting my finger off this time. anyways, something else i wanted to talk about is actually from yesterday, so it's some sorta, "time travel episode" if you will

yesterday night, on the r/nichijou discord (which i can't link cause no internet = no discord access = no invite link) i was *supposed* to be hosting a groupwatch for a nice long 1 hour and 15 minute shitpost called "khonjin house: the movie", which is a collection of the first 50 khonjin house episodes on youtube. it's marked as age restricted to where you have to sign in/make an account to confirm your age (13+ according to the terms of service on their site) in order to even see any content in the video itself. i think it's included cause of either

* a: all the swears included in it
* b: that one episode that involves the company "big dildos" **(not a real company, i have no idea if their facebook page is real though it could've been inspect element'd to heaven or hell)**

### 10:50 AM
moving on from the actual content of the movie, i was supposed to host it at around 8 AM/PM or whatever (at the time being, it was roughly 9:25 PM). which meant i was **four hours late** thanks to jeik telling me that i was late. now i get that it's like rude and everything but believe it or not my internet was down **yesterday** from when i woke up, to 12:30 PM, which is a pretty long while, i was waiting roughly 2 hours to get even 2 bars of internet on my switch (that i *do* own)

needless to say, since i was roughly now 4 and a half hours late at the time, i had no choice but to apologize to the people who were wanting to join (not many, cause of how fucking late i was (presumably (probably (yes)))), and start it anyways

we started at 10:00 PM instead whoops

anyways the people in the groupwatch were me, jitsus (my friend and one of the few writers for a webcomic i work on (more on that like soon)), nutball, and another friend of mine, which means there were a total of like 4 people in the groupwatch at max

needless to say x2 combo except it's not a combo they were 5 lines away from each other, the movie was pretty good. however, due to how late it was (the time was now like 1:00 AM), everyone but me and jitsus were blinking in and out, and nutball and that other one eventually had to leave. if i were to place rankings for how long people stayed, these would be the results

* 1st place: me (i hosted the entire thing and the few bonus videos at the end)
* 2nd place: jitsus (was there mostly the whole time and eventually left at around 1:30-2:00 AM)
* 3rd place: nutball (was blinking in and out)
* 4th place: that other guy (same as nutball, but more severe and was booted out by rabb.it much more often)

needless to say, we all liked the movie. here's my review coming right atcha in the next header like kirby back atcha

### 11:00 AM

### 11:16 AM
i did that

### 11:35 AM
**PRAISE THE LORDS THE INTERENT IS BACK**

### 11:58 AM
in conclusion of the internet crisis i will state that with every event, comes a moral. and whats the moral, you may ask?

im never going to host a groupwatch ever again the last one was a complete disaster gosh

well, the next part of our situation station trip is a game called finobe. you might ***might*** have heard of it before, but you haven't seen what the gameplay looks like! with the revolution of 256-bit color graphics from the opposite of a beige-enough device and github flavored servers and markdown, i will show you the wonders of **I M A G E R Y**!

### 12:20 PM
i had to find the images first but now that i have found them, here they will be!
credits and kudos and my club penguin credit cards (joke) to these people for the screenshots

now that you've seen the proper gameplay of finobe, it's time to choose the game!

### 12:33 PM
after 7 minutes of trying to find a game despite there only being like 2 active games, i've found one that was pretty active. it's called endless summer camp out, and by what i've heard its finobe's latest event or something. with my username of Rustox and 70 dius (finobe's tix alternative) on hand, i venture out into a big ass forest while listening to the soundtrack of LCDDEM and make my way into the forest of finobe, which is literally just a roblox emulator for 2016/2012.

that reminds me, that's exactly what finobe is, a roblox clone/emulator when it was good. ever since the bad updated and dantdm's gameplay videos of roblox it's just been flooded with a really, really bad community. believe me, there are **fnaf roleplays** in there. i wouldn't send even my *worst* enemy to roblox. i'd send them to the old new mans sky instead (when it was considered a bad game, cause no mans sky is good now!)

[oh and heres the site to finobe](http://www.finobe.com)

and now, the next few headers will include documentation of my gameplay

windows you are so full of shit sometimes

thankfully i know how to get around this, windows defender is just overprotective a lot

### 1:09 PM

so we begin with disappointment that the event is going to close relatively soon, but by the looks of it we don't leave empty handed! i found like 40 adurite buckets and i picked up one of them and i eventually just won the reward.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rustyJS/rustyjs.github.io/master/images/blog/2018/09/image_70.png)

speaking of which, here's the rewards

* adurite bucket - pretty fancy, occasionally found in a tree
* camper hat - they're everywhere, started
* marshmallow head - eat too many marshmallows and explode

since the event was ending soon, there wasn't much i could really do and there wasn't a whole lot to explain, but here's some highlight screenshots

truly, these are the saddest moments of 2018

my personal thoughts about this event were "meh, they're fine, i guess". there wasn't all that much to do, since the event closed in 10 minutes since i first joined, but i *did* get that nice adurite bucket! hopefully i'll actually be there to see the entire next event. rip endless campout, you weren't very endless in the end, cause you, uh, *ended*. this is so sad can we **not use this meme again**

### 1:39 PM
since it's sunday, school week is coming up relatively soon, and by soon i mean literally tomorrow, so i guess i can talk about something else in the meantime. lets see... oh yeah! remember at the start of this day when i stated something about n++? well, i can assure that *yes*, n++ is a game, and **yes**, it's fun, and ***yes***, i own it. the rundown of n++ is pretty freakin' simple. you're a ninja, get the coins, open a switch, get to the door, rinse and repeat. it's so simple, it can be put on a list, watch!

* get coins
* open door
* enter door
* rinse and repeat

see how easy *and* simple it is? thats why n++ is so great as the platformer it dreamt of being years ago when it was just a flash game called n. indie titles are making their way to switch much more often than it was expected (for me, at least), and i find that to be pretty intersting. maybe they're going to port nuclear throne next! i haven't actually *played* that game before, but i watched a few development streams a long time ago. needless to say, it looked fun.

let me tell you the story of n++, as in, the game story. yeah, this game has a story for just a simple freaking platformer with some of the best controls i've ever used, ever. you're a ninja, and since you're a ninja, you have a limited lifespan (the coins mentioned previously increase your timer by 2 seconds), and its a robotic future. get to the switch, open the door, and make your way through levels.

oh yeah, that reminds me again, n++ has probably the most levels in a platformer.

ever.

the game lasts about more than **2000 levels** making it chockfull of content and otherwise. anyways, back onto what *i'm* actually doing with the game, i originally had it pirated on pc a few weeks back, but then the unthinkable happened... right before the khonjin house groupwatch (when i still had n++ pirated on pc), i was told that we're going *school shopping*. now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't the worst thing of all, but it caused me to delay the original date for the khonjin house groupwatch until yesterday, in which i was still late *as* ***hell***.

what does this have to do with n++, you may ask? well, near the end of the shopping spree at every single store ever made, ever, something caught my eye. it was a $99 eshop gift card! the switch, 3ds, and wii u are all connected to the same store service. it's called "nintendo eshop", and for a while, i never really used it because most of the stuff was literally way too expensive for me. after i bought the card and after i was back from that school shopping vacation, i decided to redeem the card and buy 2 games.

* n++: the whole point of that backstory!
* puyo puyo tetris: 4-wides
* possibly minecraft, i still haven't made my mind on that yet

now that i had properly support metanet software (the developers of n++), i could finally play n++ like anyone else could! plus, the switch was faster than my pc, so i could call that a bonus too. the even *better* thing is that i could finally play user-made levels without having to resort to getting the file for the level and shoving it into the game in which i head on over to the level editor screen to play the level. man, that process sucked.

### 2:16 PM
anyways, back onto where i was supposed to go, i just *really* like n++, and rn i contributed 2 levels to the user-created levels, it's ever growing and still fascinating to see what users can come up with. onto something else.

the other thing i'd like to clear up is what exactly r/nichijou *is*. it's a discord server for the anime `nichijou: my ordinary life`, a pretty good anime series that has an over-the-top budget and a slice-of-life touch to it. there's been a lot of stuff going on over there lately like the groupwatch i talked about earlier, along with a few other events back in janurary to feburary which are like, controversial, and it's about my own webcomic before it really like picked up steam over the last few months

because of the controversial topics, i always thought i was just one of the "off" users on the discord to some people. however, i shouldn't let that wear me down, at all. i should be thankful i'm still *on* the server after those episodes. plus, i met a few new friends (not really "new" anymore but still) there too, heres a few of them

* dew - one of my closest friends on this server, we don't *really* share the same interests, but we're on good terms and he works on a novel series called `r/nichijou: my ordinary discord`, and i was featured in the second volume! there was this scene where i was stuck in a shopping cart full of *waffles*, and then i crashed into something along with someoene else. not sure who exactly since i can't really make up my mind. there was also that other chapter thats literally just called `rusty`, and let me just say this now. it's one of the best things i've ever read, ever. it made me cry the first time and it was with joy. tears of joy and mild self-deprecation. oh, and dew is a big supporter of mai from nichijou, he has like a ton of profile pictures of her, not gonna lie. they're blessed af
* jitsus - you've heard of him last time, this was where he was when i first met him, i think! he has some pretty great drawing skills and he's working on his own novel series too!
* scorcho - same as jitsus, i met him from the discord at first and he has some pretty good drawing skills. he's a big fan of megaman!
* nox - he *was* on the server, but him and shirt later got banned for abusing a bot that was once on r/nichijou called `nano`, which now i also help work on. the bot started to like say stuff, which was eventually figured out that nox and shirt had set up that using a command that allowed nano to say whatever the devs wanted it/her/whatever to say. nano is yet another character from the nichijou anime, and is also featured on the server icon. however, everyone seems to be into mio more or something. waifu wars, anyone?

man, i love that server. i wouldn't know what to do without being there in the first place! everyone's just always having a good time usually and thats why it's on the top of my server list.

i guess that concludes r/nichijou's time in the spotlight for this blog post. now back to stuff i have in my head i want to let out, and otherwise!

### 2:32 PM
i have just realized it's cirno day (september 9th (9/9)) god damnit i could've used that for the title why am i so forgetful all the time aaaaaaa

### 3:08 PM
well after taking a short nap im gonna continue on with my rambling and maybe iclude a few images

so im currently eating like 2 slices of watermelon at the moment while talking with my other close friend infinitysnapz via anydesk *while* watching every single battle for dream island episode up to season 4 episode 12

yknow bfdi sort of has a bad rap on places that aren't related to the object show community, which bfdi pretty much *created*. into detail, battle for dream island was a monthly-ish animated series created by huang brothers cary and michael, which later expanded into a webseries with millions of views per episode. however, season 4 (battle for battle for dream island/bfb) isn't as good as the other 3 in my opinion, all the characters got dumbed down a bit, and the animation is slightly cheaper. i will say the tactics they used were pretty cool.

if i were to pin point the person who does the best job working on bfb, im going to put my 2 cents to michael huang. his style fits well with the handdrawn assets instead of using symbols for all the mouths, eyes, and legs. his method of `spline tweening` ends out in a nice, smooth result that can *really* save time with animation. this explains how season 4 has already got more episodes than seasons 2 and 3! heres a table from most to last

season | episodes
--- | ---
1 | 25
4 | 12
2 | 5
3 | 1

seasons 2 and 3 have very few episodes because season 2 was too hard to produce and the episodes were taking way too long to come out, and episode 6 never really came out because of it, and has been classified cancelled. season 3 only has one episode, but the huang brothers haven't actually "*cancelled*" it, but BFB is their current project.

### 3:52 PM
im currently still on season 1 during my bingewatching, i've been finding a *new* jekyll theme that i want to try out, it's going to be a simple change, and it actually looks better than just markdown. i'll get to work on it relatively soon.

### 5:24 PM
it failed, obviously. anyways, im currently on season 1 episode 16 where all the contestants are replaced with puppet versions instead of being animated for an april fools prank

needless to say i think people got fooled real nice
