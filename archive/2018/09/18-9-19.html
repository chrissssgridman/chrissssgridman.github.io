<h1 id="day19fttafsgaesb2hls2p15inevitable">day 19 | fttafsgae.sb2hls2 p1.5 | inevitable</h2>

<p>timestamps aren't here for this one</p>

<p>the del- <em>cough</em> 'scuse me.</p>

<p>The delay was inevitable. With all of these ongoing projects, there's no way I can possibly keep things afloat without some sort of indefinite delay between posts. What can I say? At least the shared experiences were something I've always wanted to do. Now, we've passed over 450 lines in this <code>.md</code> document, and still haven't figured out what happened the past 8 or so days.

<p>You may not heard of this server much, but I'll tell you one thing. This server has <em>changed</em> who I am. Without it, I'd still be <em>"Season 2"</em> Rusty.</p>

That's not even a real word, but I still get what it means! Tune in at whatever time next time, for me to go into a touching in-depth look into <strong>who I am</strong>.</p>
