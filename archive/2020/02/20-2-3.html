<h1>rikotsura for puyo puyo tetris 2 official part 2: ss tetra's coming to town (to t-spin you)</h1>
<h2>1:05 pm</h2>
<p>hi it's me rust welcome to the second part of the puyo puyo mega blog post! last time we left off explaining a handful of the characters before we skip another forty spin-offs while also disregarding a few important characters and also screwing up the history of the game entirely. please read <a href="../01/20-1-29.html">the first part of the post</a> if you haven't already! anyways, let's recap. but before that let's also include the world famous</p>

<p>there, now we're good to go. right, recap! puyo puyo is a dr. mario like game that has most of it's games made in only japan while only a handful have (OFFICIAL) english releases with one of them being made from the same guy who made sonic adventure 2 or heroes (i forgot but it's one of the two). the publishers changed over time due to licensing which lead to the compile era and the sega era. the compile era was where we got most of the main characters, including arle who decapitated schezo because probably a crazy woman. the sega era gave us lemres, that's it. that's the only one (not really but i want to believe it is)</p>
<p>additionally, with the upcoming <i>puyo day</i> coming up later tomorrow with 25 or so announcements (with none of them being puyo puyo 30th anniversary sadly (UNLESS WE GET PROVEN WRONG FROM A TWITTER POST)). maybe they'll announce the tetris spinoff for real this time. <big>HOWEVER</big> that DOES remind me that we actually have another game to cover now... after a few more characters. sure, that's what caused the delays but THAT'S NOT STOPPING ME FROM COVERING A FEW MORE!</p>

            <p>the green bad guy who does all the funny bad things and also almost caused everyone to die of a heat stroke that one time during the game puyo puyo sun during the compile era! yeah that's why nobody likes the dark prince (otherwise known as literally satan in japan idk why but this is more of a compile moment ...............). this bitch decided to go level 9 cpu mode on me every time in puyo puyo tetris and in both modes the guy literally 0-2's me like it's absolutely nothing. additionally ol' darkish prancer over here wants to marry arle who shot him with a gun that one time during the compile-era and it's like they never bring it up. like c'mon that's going to leave SOME scars on you. schezo out here having to be the dirk strider of the puyo puyo character list and this BASTARD's just playing the ukelele because he powered the dumbass sun into a yellow giant and now it's 40 thousand million degrees and he's just CHILLING LIKE NO TOMORROW. the dank dunce caused global warming and he suxxors. now if you excuse me im going to cannonball myself into the sun in hopes of breaking it like mere glass.</p>

            <p>note that this also confirms that according to the skeletal system of puyo puyo characters, they should all have thighs so have fun with that or some shit. also the dude never shows up anymore besides the quest game but yeah that's how it works doe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
            <p>(im joking, obviously)</p>

<h1>4th</h1>
<h2>9:00 am</h2>
<p>whoops, silly me once again. time for the additional characters! then it's vibeo grame time.</p>

            <font size="6"><b>amitie</b></font>
            <p>you ever look at something and go "wow, i want to hug this lovingly so bad because this is absolutely adorable"? this is the definition. amitie is the cheerful yet clueless/naive and can get r/wooshed and lose upvote very easily. however, her epicness and sonic adventure-like cutscene in puyo puyo fever (where they also mispronounce arle's name as "ar-le" instead of "ar-ul" and that someone made it to bloody fuckin' retail. but still, sonic adventure 2 cutscene guys. with the character portrait and funny words on screen. according to the super accurate and totally not at all wikipedia-like puyo nexus wiki (joking btw), amitie has a pure heart, and also wants to be a wonderful sorceress yet has little skill with the magic involved. additionally, amitie's energeticness makes her a bit lacking with social interactivity and can be clumsy. but that's what makes her cooler R I G H T ? right! amitie's a pure happy soul who deserves a hug. yes</p>
        </td>

<p>the rest we'll cover later. however, for now, let's get into the concept of the next bloody game! after puyo puyo 7 and a few spinoffs after that and fever, we now FINALLY introduce you to the game that took one and one together... PUYO PUYO TETRIS! the vibeo grame to defeat all vibeo grames except probably not !!! puyo puyo tetris is what introduces us to several new characters, the ss tetra, yet none of them actually get new appearances until puyo puyo quest, in which still they don't get nearly as much affection as the main characters, some having triple as many as variations as the tetris related ones! makes you wonder why they haven't done more with the concept. sure, there's licensing issues with the tetris company and sega, but i'm sure the two can come together and make something marvelous.</p>
<h2>9:45 am</h2>
<p>damn, right at the good part too. the next cdli class is science and i have a test today, not to mention there's no other cdli class after that. wish me luck, see you soon!</p>
