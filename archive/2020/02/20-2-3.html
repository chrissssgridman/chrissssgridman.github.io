<h1>rikotsura for puyo puyo tetris 2 official part 2: ss tetra's coming to town (to t-spin you)</h1>
<h2>1:05 pm</h2>
<p>hi it's me rust welcome to the second part of the puyo puyo mega blog post! last time we left off explaining a handful of the characters before we skip another forty spin-offs while also disregarding a few important characters and also screwing up the history of the game entirely. please read <a href="../01/20-1-29.html">the first part of the post</a> if you haven't already! anyways, let's recap. but before that let's also include the world famous</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>there, now we're good to go. right, recap! puyo puyo is a dr. mario like game that has most of it's games made in only japan while only a handful have (OFFICIAL) english releases with one of them being made from the same guy who made sonic adventure 2 or heroes (i forgot but it's one of the two). the publishers changed over time due to licensing which lead to the compile era and the sega era. the compile era was where we got most of the main characters, including arle who decapitated schezo because probably a crazy woman. the sega era gave us lemres, that's it. that's the only one (not really but i want to believe it is)</p>
<p>additionally, with the upcoming <i>puyo day</i> coming up later tomorrow with 25 or so announcements (with none of them being puyo puyo 30th anniversary sadly (UNLESS WE GET PROVEN WRONG FROM A TWITTER POST)). maybe they'll announce the tetris spinoff for real this time. <big>HOWEVER</big> that DOES remind me that we actually have another game to cover now... after a few more characters. sure, that's what caused the delays but THAT'S NOT STOPPING ME FROM COVERING A FEW MORE!</p>

<p>the rest we'll cover later. however, for now, let's get into the concept of the next bloody game! after puyo puyo 7 and a few spinoffs after that and fever, we now FINALLY introduce you to the game that took one and one together... PUYO PUYO TETRIS! the vibeo grame to defeat all vibeo grames except probably not !!! puyo puyo tetris is what introduces us to several new characters, the ss tetra, yet none of them actually get new appearances until puyo puyo quest, in which still they don't get nearly as much affection as the main characters, some having triple as many as variations as the tetris related ones! makes you wonder why they haven't done more with the concept. sure, there's licensing issues with the tetris company and sega, but i'm sure the two can come together and make something marvelous.</p>
<h2>9:45 am</h2>
<p>damn, right at the good part too. the next cdli class is science and i have a test today, not to mention there's no other cdli class after that. wish me luck, see you soon!</p>
<h1>5th</h1>
<h2>11:30 am</h2>
<p>welcome back! i took the time to finish drawing ringo yesterday in celebration of puyo day!</p>
<center><img src="../../../images/blog/2020/02/ringo.png" width="20%"></center>
<p>besides that i almost forgot to update the post today! anyways today we're finally going to go in detail about puyo puyo tetris. puyo puyo tetris, as i said, is the ONLY puyo puyo game that i actually own. additionally, i first gave the game a shot on nintendo switch. essentially, puyo puyo tetris is when licensing actually gets you somewhere with sega and the tetris company. i mean, there probably is a tetris game on ONE of the sega consoles they made a decade or two ago, like the saturn. maybe the game gear? probably not the game gear. but, my point still stands. puyo puyo tetris at first sounds like an unlikely crossover to begin with, but thanks to the designers over at puyo puyo they were able to turn the tetris blocks into likable and unique characters. puyo puyo never had this issue because they already had characters at the start, yet tetris was always just a bunch of falling blocks. that changed (for that game only as of rn) however, and GOD do i like the designs. more on that later</p>
<p>i would argue there's more puyo than tetris, but it also introduces a new mode unique to puyo puyo tetris, which i find to be pretty fun (even with cpu players) yet it only comes in a battle mode and there's no marathon based mode for it. much like you would expect, it combines BOTH PUYO and TETRIS in a blender and expects you to handle both. it's a wonderful concept and i wished it was given more time to mature in more games. would've been great! however, i'm getting ahead of myself here. it's time to dabble into the first notable part of puyo puyo tetris before we really get into the fun, exciting parts.</p>
<h2>12:00 pm</h2>
<p>sike, the time don't allow for any of that! see you during probably not science (the other cdli class we have today) because it's science. it really likes to grab your attention to every little nitty gritty detail. i shouldn't complain though, i sorta already have. but once i get back, we'll get into the <big><b>STORY MODE</b> (wowzers)</big>. until then!</p>
<h1>6th</h1>
<h2>11:05 am</h2>
<p>welcome back to rust_ talks about a game for an entire bloody week, today we're going to continue talking about the story mode of puyo puyo tetris, the only puyo game i've bought in my entire life, and also the latest official tetris company product i've bought in a while. the best of both worlds collide in what seems to focus more on puyo puyo than anything until we get into fusion more (more on that later.) you all know how tetris goes down if you're a real person. blocks fall from the sky and you got to clear horizontal lines in order to clear them and progress. however, what if i told you that this game actually came out in <b>2014 ON 3DS, WII U, PSV AND PS3</b>. and only in JAPAN. i know right? absolutely mindblowing. it even scrambled it's way into the xbox one somehow after the PS4, with then a switch release in 2017. how come we get all the less stuff and japan just bloody SWIMS in epicness? whatever, i shouldn't complain. if it weren't for that, i would have never gotten into puyo puyo to begin with. you know what time it is now? <big>IT'S STORY TIME ON HOW THE GAME GOES DOWN</big></p>
<p class="boxed"><marquee scrollamount="100px"><b><font size="10px">SPOILER ALERT WEE WOO WEE WOO</font></b></marquee></p>
<p>the reason why i'm telling you an abridged version of the story is because this is essentially one huge ass review and i have experienced the entire story...besides the last two extra acts (the first one i have played. more on that...eventually)</p>
<h3>act not one quite yet: the opening</h3>
<p>ringo's just standing there commenting on the rather peacefulness (a rare sighting) at suzuran junior high and then commits butch hartman (sorta) where when ringo thinks her friends may burst out of the sky, in which SURPRISE SURPRISE, they fall outta the sky!!!!! cut to hank j wimbleton i mean arle and amitie. they then have some good commentary on how the hell puyos have INTERDIMENSIONAL TRAVELLING ABILITIES (hot damn). the three, despite these circumstances and new discoveries of dimensional travel, decide that they'll stay together even at the edge of the universe (which is a broad and possibly impossible approach, that stuff hasn't been fully researched yet). however, the opposite occurs (AKA A BUTCH HARTMAN) and tetriminos begin to fall out of the sky. those are the names for those blocks! yeah what else was it gonna be smartass, blocks? pills? square puyos? WRONG!!!!!!!!!!! tetriminos for you. (some other spellings include tetriminoes but really, it's tetriminos seems like). if you remember from puyos causing travel, the three witness a single line being cleared and also commenting how sastifying it was. ringo, being the logical based person, realizes this equals interdimensional travel! the three now get warped into three random places inside a spaceship (named the SS TETRA, a very epic ship name. would want to be there), where we get introduced to <b>Tee</b> and <big><b>O</b></big>, the captain and the one that submits captain reports respectively. ringo, in the playroom, obviously has a panic attack, and tee has to find out "who tf are these people i did not expect VISITORS today !!!!!!!!!!"</p>

<h3>act one: flagrant system error oopsie</h3>
<p>continuing from the opening, ringo is currently in the play room of the ss tetra appearing to have a mental breakdown that her friends may be somewhere totally different, not knowing the three are all in the same room. personally maybe you should invest in interdimensional phone travel, i would worry about the costs of that, though. not sure how much you'll be paying for that service. either way, ringo freaks out to the point where tee and o actually hear her. tee shows up, and sees ringo. ringo fears tee at first and they decide to... do a PUYO PUYO battle in order to resolve the situation. however, tee has no idea what the hell a puyo is, to ringo's immediate concern.</p>
<h2>12:00 pm</h2>
<p>whoops, we can't do that for now, it's lunch time. more on act one later! next up for me is french and social studies, so i'm sure i'll be able to cram another hour into the abridged story later. bye for now, stan tee and ringo from puyo puyo (tetris)</p>
<h2>2:02 pm</h2>
<p>welcome back to the rust_ show, last time we left off with ringo amitie and <i>arle</i> stuck on the ss tetra after witnessing one of the 150 lines of tetris blocks being cleared when they started falling out of the sky. tee and o, the main two of the ship, notice the cries of ringo after losing her friends during the epic interdimensional travel. back to where we left off</p>
<h3>act one part two: oops still looks like the ss tetra has new people</h3>
<p>tee looks at ringo and instantly thinks that her scared blabber nonsense is an improvised alien comedy routine. how the hell does that work, you two are speaking the <b>same bloody language</b>, of <i>ALL THINGS</i>, you instantly think an alien's on board. anyways, as i said, ringo notices tee existing in the middle of the room and the first thing she comments on is that he's wearing tight clothes. she thinks that tee caused the blocks to fall right out of the sky (based on logic) and demands that the two battle TO THE DEATH !!!!!!!!!!! oops i meant PUYO PUYO BATTLE!!!!!!!!!! however tee thinks that ringo is talking about tetris, and the two realize they use different battle game type things. they comment on this seemingly perfectly</p>

<p>however the magic of plot and the game itself forces them to play their own modes in the same battling environment, which in fact doesn't end in a violent explosion killing the both of them with ease alongside the rest of the ss tetra. it actually just goes just fine! after ringo calms down from having several panic attacks about her friends and realizing that the person she was fighting with doesn't exactly use funny haha dr mario jelly beans, tee introduces himself as the captain of the ss tetra, alongside what the whole tetris ordeal is. ringo does the same but with introducing tee (and for most other people over in the western zone act 2 (canada and such), them as well) to puyo puyo. also adding the fact that they can <b>travel to different worlds</b>. for topics that broad she sure does like to talk about it rather casually.</p>
<center><img src="../../../images/blog/2020/02/image_33.png" width="50%"></center>
<p>additionally, i also want you to take the time to look at tee being happy. this is actually a rather important detail. lets move forth now. tee and ringo now go around the ship to meet the rest of da COOL GANG OF SS TETRA. we now introduce you to amitie again (<i>yay !!!!!!!</i>) and <b>ess</b>, another ss tetra crew member</p>

            <p>ess, far as i know, has a strong spot on her sense of fashion, being cute and innocent at the first glance (at which yes, she is cute). however, she can be bratty and rude towards others, and most certainly when they annoy her, ESPECIALLY when she's busy with something. despite this, she acts warm and respectful when zed is around (more on IT/HIM later), who ess thinks is her father when it's actually someone else being her true father, but we'll get to that later too. but for ess, she's a cute and bratty girl with a good taste and fashion and only acts well behaved when zed is around.</p>

<h2>2:55 pm</h2>
<p>oops time to pause the introduction of ess and amitie again, it's almost time to go home for the rest of the day. see you when i get back!</p>
<h1>7th</h1>
<p>right... let's just get right into it.</p>
<h3>act one part three: ess and amitie exist once more, who would've seen that one coming? (not me of course (just kidding i know))</h3>
<p>so yeah ess and amitie are on the ss tetra (ess being one of the crew members of coolness). ess asks amitie one simple question by instead asking several questions like my math book questions where they for some reason put several questions in the same question. im surprised she hasn't said "what the FUCK is sonic". but yeah, she asks amitie a lot of questions at once, leading amitie to go into CONFUSED AMITIE MODE (not to mention ess calls amitie weird. damn what an asshole ????) by mentioning her brain hurts. not cool ess........not cool. ess, much like tee previously, has no idea what the flicking frick a puyo is which only causes more questions. ess also doesn't think magic is real. ess is pissed off to the point where she could smack amitie with a tetrimino. what are those made of anyways, metal? plastic? soft fur you would use with blankets? i'd prefer the last one. amitie meeps out of the situation by saying "meep!" tee, ringo, and o find the two. ringo states that amitie can be a handful. oh NOW look who the dingus is....... although, she calls ess abusive in which that works out. the girl was about to smack amitie with a block, i think that says something on it's own. ess then looks at tee and they proceed to argue about ess being supposed to nap in peace, a """supposed""" captain's sworn <strike>call of</strike> duty. tee then describes rather angrily that he can't be everywhere, ess replying that he's useless. amitie notices tee because of his strangle clothes (says the one who used to have a hat with wings). amitie is furious that tee's there and.. the two decide to battle with puyo to calm amitie down? long as it works. anyways, after that, amitie questions what the blocks were and then decides to take that off her shoulder and happily wants to do the battle again because it was fun, proceeded by a giggle. i think you now know why amitie is baby, shes normally happy despite the situation.</p>
<p>after that whole argument, the gang of.. uh, four peoples go and find arle. amitie mentions that if you hear a "gugu", that means you're probably close. that's the carbuncle of the arle for you, totally not decapitation in mind. okay that joke's getting a bit stale at this point, my apologies. ess aka dunkass recalls that she heard a gugu earlier, so the three (((((and ess))))) head out to where the gugu was heard. except not, because we're actually on a detour to TWO OR THREE NEW CHARACTERS. UH OH!!!!!! ACT ONE INTERMISSION (no wait this is still act one)</p>

<h3>act one part four: pants. hurhurhruuhhhuhuhuuhrhurhuruhru</h3>
<p>so yeah jay and elle are messin around with ai as part of their daily todo list, the equivalent of "go to work go to work go to work go to work go to work go to work go to work go to work go to work go to work go to work". the two say they didn't do stuff such as pelt life frogs at the dog. like DAMN how the hell do you get frogs in SPACE? SPACE OF ALL THINGS AND YOU FIND DA FROG. you're just listing all the stuff you just did, dinguses. you're not very good at this pranking thing if you publicly say the thing you are going to do before you do it. least their voices are smooth. amitie refers to the dog as a puppy, ringo asking about it, and then asking tee about it. however, i appear to have mistaken their slow voices for sarcasm and that they haven't actually done any pranks to the dog at all, including pelting live frogs and tail tug-of-war. ai actually saw arle the gugu man (aka carbuncle). tee and ai have to fight each other with tetris to calm down ai. the dog then returns to his senses. the gang then goes to arle. and then o says one line.</p>

            <p>beep boop bop boo boo beep bop beep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0nxKPBiceo">*crazy frog theme plays*</a>. also the fake father of ess, who always treats zed like the fatherly figure, mainly due to the body shape. weird, huh? you always think it would be some other reason but nah ess is probably like half blind or the big dumb. mr krabs because zed is based on the red s piece.</p>

<p>zed is being content-suggestive towards arle in a way that you could take their dialogue out of context and tell someone it's the funny sex scene. uh oh. not cool bro !!!!! however, zed instead just wants arle and carbuncle to not actually commit sexual intercourse but rather eat food and brush teeth. regarding how arle never changes her clothes i think that explains why zed is driving off the wall. amitie and ringo question it, but amitie just says run and giggles. zed has this whole list of demands which are mostly hygienic, and arle just commits the "NOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooo" from battle for dream island and does not commit eat healthy food. WORST OF ALL, zed lectured arle on... <b>PROPER HAND SANITIZATION TECHNIQUES</b>!!!!!!!!! that BASTURD !!!!! who does he think he is ???!??!!????!??!???!??!? this also means that arle has a poor sense of manners. i mean yeah she never changes her clothes. even carbuncle complains about it. but hey, least we have the entire ss tetra crew covered. arle meets tee, the captain, and expects tee to have the same list of demands, yet this is obviously false. the two battle, ringo admitting this is how every situation gets resolved. you ever think that's also how they decide who rolls first in a board game? whatever, the entire gang's together!!</p>
<p>OOPS do you hear that ALARM? NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T THAT'S WHATS HAPPENIN IN DA STORY DUNKASS! it appears the ss tetra.....committed an oops moment! the tetra emergency alarm's going off, and everyone goes to the cockpit before the predicament gets any worse. it appears the puyos have invaded the funny ship! everyone is obviously complaining about this and are trying to pop the things. however, what are they even doing? maybe they're tryna order more space frog branded pizza out from the mcdonalds galaxy. so basically these dumbass blobs caused the cockpit to stop working and they put their blobby hands all over the controls. but wait, what's this? the ships being pulled by a PLANET GRAVITATIONAL FIELD. UH OH! we're about to crash booooooooys. get your plot armor on. ringo and ess scream slightly higher than average, and everyone's gotta go as soon as as soon as possible as possible. tee also asks ringo to help pop puyos, and ringo asks tee on how to clear tetriminos. ringo also possibly jinxes the entire gang into dying by saying that they'll hopefully not die when they land. the jinx means they might die when they land. fuck this about to be like the time sanford and deimos got crushed by a giant building dance party thing during the beginning events of madness combat 5.5 up in heres. some popping later, whole thing's cleared! except then it's not by sudden background change and now they're crashing for real this time. cue the explosion</p>
