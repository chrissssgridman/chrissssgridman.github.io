<h1>rikotsura for puyo puyo tetris 2 official</h1>
<h2>10:29 am</h2>
<p>hi all, rust here, and DAMN it appears that i forgot that i was going to go and take my sweet precious time to write a post regarding a new game (and series, maybe, for that matter) that i had recently bought on steam during when christmas sale was still going around and a lot of games became what looked to be dirt cheap! i still got $20 or so left on my steam card <small>(not to mention an extra <b>$50</b> on a visa prepaid that im not sure what the expiry date is on it)</small> but i would assume things are all fine regarding to that! anyways, if you took the time to read the bloody <a href="20-1-27.html">last post</a> you would know that next post was going to be all about puyo puyo. additionally, i am also suffering immensely in science class and i really don't want to fill in on the details. additionally, it's also come to my attention that actually no one looks at my website. i've been rambling on and on for basically no reason now, which is outstanding. pretty demotivating i'll be honest. sorta like the old saying, if a tree falls down and no one's there, did it really fall down? ...actually, i'm not sure if that's the way it goes. look, i don't bloody care. i wanna talk about how lemres taught me the definition of gay, not how my science teacher reminds me of my dad when the dog pisses on the floor. not like it ever ends well. <b>BUuUUuuuuUt</b>, that's a different cookie for a different glass of milk(???). i got a puyo puyo to talk about i hope you like robotnik's mean bean machine (which was our original western version of puyo puyo. why is the western so garbage. holy fuck)</p>
<p class="boxed"><b>further ramblings:</b><br>can i just say this now before io get on with puyo puyo and how much i got into the franchise because of the steam version of puyo puyo tetris? the western's methods of bringing one franchise to another country is DOGSHIT. puyo puyo looks far more interesting than ROBOTNIK'S GREEN BEAN MACHINE. it's generally just legally copying a game and making something new out of it when obviously it's supposed to be something else. note that this was obviously before the mobile market was never original ever since piano tiles 2 started selling out with ED SHEERAN, ugh.<br><br>i'd also like to mention that most puyo puyo games aren't even being localized to the west, which further bothers me. they have an entire mobile game and a 3DS GAME that they thought "NNNNNNAH I DON'T FEEL LIKE BRINGING PUYO PUYO TO THE WEST. WE GOT A MOVIE ABOUT A BLUE FURRY <I>FUCK</I> TO DEAL WITH". alright wew sorry about that i'm just not feelin that well</p>
<h2>10:40 am</h2>
<p>fuck i was just gonna get started with a basic rundown of it. the next subject i have after this is life skills and the next cdli subject isn't until 2 pm during the afternoon. life, why do you have to be such a bitch? anyways yeah sorry for the long and hasty introduction, i actually have to go now for recess, see you at either 12:05 pm, 2 pm, or just not at all for the rest of the day. i really need to start reminding myself to write on time more often. anyways bye i would tell you to stan someone (BUT THAT'S FOR LATER...)</p>
