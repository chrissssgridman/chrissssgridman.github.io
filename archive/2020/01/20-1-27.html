<h2>8:58 am</h2>
<p>hi i'm rust and fuck it's monday!!! yesterday i finished up my previous blog post and i started working on my brand new big part of the site. however, the current status of the new page is unfinished and does not have all the details yet. it's the brand new <a href="../../../misc.html">more page</a>! there, you can download cool things like wallpapers and old little tidbits, look at my portfolio, and download the assets that i use for a lot of my things. im not sure what else i'll add to the page after that but i'm sure i'll figure something out! anyways as of right now i'm at career class again with french up next, which is a good group project in the works! i'd say my day's going to be rather enjoyable. however, i won't be able to work much on the more page because the graphics and files are on my home laptop. the other files i could gather would be all of my profile pictures (since i had a version of them backed up on my school google drive) or offline versions of all my scratch projects, and if they're add yourselves or stories, the latest remix tree would be provided. however, you should also be aware that there are also over <b>five hundred projects</b> that i would have to manually download by going inside of it and pressing the download button on each. single. one. they never fixed this during the scratch 3.0 merge as they never made tools that export all of your backpack or projects. no, see, they just told you how to bloody do it ONE BY ONE. like, god, they couldn't bother making specific tools? not cool!</p>
<p class="boxed">bfdi bingewatch progress, episode 19 ( yeah i left off from 17 but i forgot to tell you B) ), leafy and ice cube fall off a really big cliff edge on unicycles because they thought bubbles could backstab. haha dumbasses</p>
<p>nah but seriously the current stuff is stuff i've already told you about now. not really a use in talking about it if it's been mentioned to several times. speaking of which i should try and bloody stop wasting my damn time watching objects fail at unicycles and rather actually send those questions from the interview project. only people who pay attention to previous events will get this reference. i'll close off the post for now and get to bloody work</p>
