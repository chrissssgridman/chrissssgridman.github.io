<h1>a new roaring twenties is born</h1>
<h2>11:23 am</h2>
<p>hey hey hey, it's none other than the roaring twenties! god, i haven't updated this site in a fair bit. i was working on a bunch of other stuff as of late (and plain messing around) but i also wanted to introduce a few new games to the steam library of mine. there's a lot i want to go over that's mostly about the new steam games i got alongside just other stories i wanted to go ahead and talk about. honestly, i think that was the entire point of these blog posts anyways. originally, they were small posts on r/nichijou in which i would just talk about what happened that day. they suggested that i take it somewhere else that isn't #general because it was acting like a <i>diary</i>, but that's what caused the idea for the website to begin with. man, i remember when it was still all in markdown for the easier formatting. guess who was bloody wrong on that lol. now we got all this cool fancy stuff and i would say it was by ALL MEANS <i>well worth</i> that time trying to make the site the way it is. i also like how some people consider the site some sort of old 2000's styled site. i mean, i ain't complaining! that's a nice site graphic design sort of thing. maybe i should get a windows media player theme to go along with that. like, foobar2000 is nice and all for music (and is lightweight) but BRO. windows media player can play MIDIs. that's something the regular foobar2000 can't do unless you attach a 3rd party plugin to that. even <i>then</i> it would be inferior because the midi instruments used aren't the classical instruments we all know and love because they were originally heard mostly from vinesauce. <small>felix have u been fucking with the piano. FELIX</small></p>
<p>anyways i'm at school as you might expect. however, a stroke of luck has hit my hometown today! a snow storm is brewing around the place due to wind warnings and such, but do you know what that means? yeah, <i>no school during the afternoon!</i> additionally, this also means the weekend is only some margins longer. but hey, i still ain't complaining about it! it's more time off. better than no time off, i'll be honest. anyways, i don't really have much to go off of here considering my school ditto clipboard is currently filled to the brim with useless information on a slew of CDLI projects.</p>

<p>besides that though, i guess i could talk about one recent-ish thing that happened during the start of the year on... <b>twitter</b>. oh fuck oh god, not the merciless twitter dot com! twitter flipped over my game of ms. monopoly (which sucks btw) and ate all my soda. i can't believe twitter would do this to me-ok nevermind. right, so, if you're BLOODY BLIND and you haven't checked the news recently, i'm about to get all political up in heres you better get your ol' "damn this guy's about get all political up in heres" safety hats and radiation costumes because i'm going to talk about <big><b>WORLD WAR FUCKING THREE</b></big>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! donald duck accidentally (maybe) killed an important leader in iran and now everyone's hating monald dick for killed some guy in I'm Going to Iran! so yeah basically the united states yet again fucking SLIPPED A FRICK and made someone kick the bucket. <strike>WHEN WILL YOU LEARN THAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES</strike>. anyways as the time grows closer to 12:05 PM i'll go and play some tetris and pause on this post for now. as of late, i actually improved my 40L sprint score to a mere 55 seconds! that's the best i've done. speaking of which, the platform that i used for that, <a href="https://jstris.jezevec10.com/">jstris</a>, allows me to export the file as a <code>.gif</code> (or webm) which allows me to show it anywhere easier! i present to you that exact gif of my 55s 40L sprint that i did earlier this week, a stunning 14 MB too.</p>

<p>it's amazing. beautiful, and glorious all at the same time! anyways, the time's 11:56 AM (i usually change the header before i say shit like this but i'm gonna keep it by the hour for now.) so i better get prepared to go for the rest of the day and enjoy my weekend. the snow really wants to get in through this window that i have, but i won't let it, ahahahahaha.</p>
