<h1>Rust_ Episode 25: Return of the Grammar (ft. Baritone)</h1>
<h2>1:31 AM</h2>
<p class="footnote"><b>NOTE:</b> Grammar returns in this post. Who would've known?</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Rust. Been a while since the last post. I was working on some <i>behind-the-hood</i> stuff, most notably the new header, which I've announced before in the previous news ticker below the menu buttons. As the time of me writing this, It's 1:32 AM and I'm bored as hell. With the semi-recent introduction of, you know, <i>that</i> virus, it's a no-brainer I've had plenty of free time to do whatever. Legend has it that boredom is what can sometimes spawn the <a href="../../full/rikotsuraforpuyopuyotetris2official.html">craziest of posts</a>.</p>
<p>Besides that, I've generally just been messing about, doing stuff unrelated to this website. For example, I've recently gotten back into Tumblr, with my new blog available <a target="_blank" href="https://rustmotherboard.tumblr.com/">here</a>. This obviously isn't going to rule out new website updates.. I mean, <i>this page exists</i>. That does remind me, I should get around to properly adding stuff to my portfolio. It's looking a bit "still not implemented" at the moment, and I should look into that. Website shit besides, figured I'd go on about another story (for lack of a better term) for tonight. For the past year, I don't exactly remember if I've talked about this before, but I've been on a Minecraft server for a good while now. The server's called <b>Pandamium</b> (address <code>pandamium.eu</code>), which is a semi-vanilla server mainly focused on the Survival mode. Thankfully, unlike <i>some</i> servers, it's not using any pay-to-win methods. Hell, the only donator-only perks you're really getting are faster cooldowns, more <code>/home</code> and <code>/rp</code> claims (more chunks included). That and cosmetic stuff, like putting a banner on your head.</p>
<p class="footnote">I had first thought that the whole banner head thing was already a feature in vanilla Minecraft, but nope! Turned out to be a server plugin, much like the ability to sit on stairs. Didn't even know that was a feature until the time I accidentally right clicked on some stone slabs. More you know, I guess.</p>
<h2>2:34 AM</h2>
<p>The server also acts kinda like Hermitcraft, with the inclusion of a shopping district. You can use diamonds (or other items) to purchase items like blocks and valuables. You'd think the economy would be fine, but simply voting for the server on it's three to four server listings allows you to redeem those votes for diamonds. In that case, the economy is not very good, as you can easily get 4 diamonds a day, or even MORE if you have an alternate account on hand. You don't even <i>HAVE</i> to be on the server in order for your votes to count! The damn thing knows either way. Eventually, you'll have diamonds <b>up the ass</b> and maybe a new rank to go alongside it. Ranks also help with <code>/tpa</code> and <code>/home</code> timers, alongside giving you more chunk claims.</p>
<p class="footnote">The <code>/rp</code> command actually stands for <b>RedProtect</b>, yet another server plugin that lets you secure your builds from getting tampered with by unwanted visitors <small>(more on that later)</small>. You can set flags on what can be interacted with and even what naturally spawns in the area. Said area being created by wrapping the building in a ring of fences and then placing a sign with specific terms:</p>
<ol>
    <li>[rp]</li>
    <li>Name of the claim</li>
    <li>Additional owners</li>
    <li>Also additional owners</li>
</ol>
<p class="footnote">You can add additional players by using commands under <code>/rp</code>, but I don't want to <i>only</i> talk about what you can do in the server, but rather what <i>I did</i> on the server.</p>
<p>I'd get into how it all began, even after I just described how the server works. However, it's running late for me, so I should take some time to rest first before I take the time to tell you all about the experiences with Pandamium. See you in a few hours time!</p>
