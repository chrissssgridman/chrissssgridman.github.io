## welcome back to my epic lets play
### 7:44 PM
After finally importing the rest of my Blogspot posts, I'm finally back to making posts on my GitHub Pages site! I feel the need for using Blogger wasn't really needed at all, so I took an hour or so on fixing up this site's obvious errors (as the home shortcut is always on the top of these pages!) and also importing all my old posts from Blogger. This was mainly made to let you guys know that this site is still kicking. No Jekyll, just markdown. I *did* hear that markdown has custom HTML/CSS support, but until I see marquee's return, I ain't interested.

Marquee was an HTML command that allowed people to make text scroll like a news headline, which I do remember experimenting with way back. However, these sites no longer exist, as they were `.html` files on my *very* old laptop.

I have some stuff I want to talk about today, but first, I'm gonna go push all the changes I did with the new blogger import posts. You'll find them [here](https://rustmotherboard.github.io/blog), once they're available. I have 66 files to add in (including this one!).

Give me a moment.
