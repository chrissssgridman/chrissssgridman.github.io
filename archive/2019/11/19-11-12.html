    <h2>9:18 am</h2>
    hi it's me rust and damn i missed remembrance day! im supposed to be having some form of science class right now but our teacher doesn't appear to be here for some odd enough reason. i don't know why she's off this late, but i have a sneaking suspicion that something rather <i>odd</i> is at the seems.
    <h2>9:30 am</h2>
    oh never mind. anyways today the weekends over and now the school thing is back in session. science test coming up tomorrow and the schedule includes math <i>and</i> french so im not really up to do anything and im actually pretty tired. today i wanted to talk about some objectbloxia stuff once again because i feel today's topic may be rather interesting for the none of you that actually watch drama alert. before we begin, i also wanted to mention that the new <a href="../../../games.html">games</a> page is out, which contains playable embeds of most, if not all of my scratch games! that added a lot of new pages to the website for each game (because if i  were to just include every project embed on one page it would take a while to load and would be a bit more laggy, especially for cursor rampage 2 as it uses multiple versions, since there's some versions that act differently than others, which i find to be rather interesting.) one of the versions actually include a <b>boss fight</b> that i still actually haven't beaten after all of this time. kinda disappointing for me if i had to be honest.

    UGH i was just about to get into detail with the objectbloxia stuff but now i almost have to go for life skills (and then math) anyways!!!!!!!! this is not what i envisioned. i'll see you guys in a few hours, then i'll talk about the rather interesting objectbloxia stuff that <i>does</i> get a little feisty. that's all i can say for now. ok byeeEEEEEEEE
