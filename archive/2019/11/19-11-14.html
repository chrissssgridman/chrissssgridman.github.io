    <h1>the object roleplay hierarchy part 2</h1>
    <h2>9:01 am</h2>
    hi it's me rust and this is just tradition again isn't it? yeah i forgot to type about yesterday and now we have this 2 parter once again, probably longer. so today i'll continue off of where we left off. alright so yeah object whatever and the "super cool secret dev menu" thing. in this case, the dev menu is for morphs made by the developers that only <i>they</i> can use. no one else can use it due to how it's scripted into the game. if i were to get the developer role (in which that's what im hoping to get) this would allow me to use all the funny btools/F3X (the tools used to build on the servers) alongside being able to use developer morphs, such as the ones i was hoping to add in. downside here is that the creator, cherry, doesn't have the service that the <i>rest</i> of us use in order to communicate on something off of roblox's turf, that being discord. yep, the one that ALL the parents hate!!! like DUDE imagine if a discord user that was reported on the news for no reason said "trans rights", then parents all around the WORLD would start hating TRANS PEOPLE 'cause that <b>ONE GUY</b> said it
    <br>
    <br>
    back on track yeah the point of this <i>whole</i> thing was to show cherry my worth so <i>he</i> could add <b><i>me</i></b> to the object whatever dev team so i could get away from objectbloxia for a bit. for the people who don't know, one guy keeps showing up on objectbloxia and has always been a pain in the ass ever since he first joined due to some of the worst behavior i've seen from a person with the worst arguments and sole purpose is to piss everyone off. surprisingly, it wasn't from 4chan, although i haven't checked up on tha. <i>no</i> it's just master. what, you think it'd be someone <b>important</b>? HAAAAAAAAAAAAH, you must be J O K I N G my dude! this dude's a wreck and i treat him like one too. lately i've come up with the most BRILLIANT idea to deal with these.......CLOWNS!!!!!!!!!! as of late. with the invention of admin scripts, we can do rAtHeR wAcKy ThInGs called jailing people. the command <code>:jail (player)</code>, of course! this command allows me to trap people in a rectangular transparent box so that it looks like they're in a rather cool futuristic jail cell. the players in it won't be ale to get out of the jail, and if they try to reset they'll just be brought back into the jail,they're only way of getting out of it being to either rejoin the game or wait until someone used <code>:unjail (player)</code> to remove them from the jail.
    <br>
    <br>
    so what does jailing people have to do with my idea? does it involve <i>creating a communist environment</i>? while we already have roblox china during an unfinished season, that is <b>not the case my DUDE!!!!!!</b> this is actually something ive been doing for a bit but haven't really done it in a better mood until of recently, introducing the not so nbrand new <b><i>LAMP TECHNIQUE!</i></b> the lamp technique is where you use <code>:jail (player)</code> and <code>:light (player) ffffff</code> to make them act like a lamp, stationary and emitting light. on occasions i also like to turn on <code>:nograv (player)</code> and <code>:loopfling (player)</code> so that they fling  around like they're in space endlessly. the nograv command makes their gravity close to zero and loopfling is just fling but in an endless loop until using <code>:unloopfling (player)</code> to make them stop flopping like a fish all the time, although there's also the command <code>:seizure (player)</code> that literally does just THAT, make them flop like a fish like if they were listening to epic RAVE MUSIC. speaking of which, here's today's featured song that probably fits into this category. very good Tune's!!!

    okay that's enough EPIC DANCING. BACK ON TRACK! this whole lamp technique was actually made for me to handle master in such a way that might actually benefit <i>both</i> sides of the argument. what the HELL do i mean by that? well the lamp thing allows master to still be part of the game (although i keep a close eye on him) but handicapped in a way that makes him less of a threat towards the rest of the community unless he starts spamming, then of which i just do the mute and/or kick, or ban if any admins are around. really, the whole thing is based on <i>conditions</i> and what to expect out of it.
    <h2>9:45 am</h2>
    oh golly, look at the time. it's time for me to go. well, i'll talk about more of the time when i use the lamp technique and even show off screenshots this time around when i get back! i have another cdli class after recess and at the last subject for the afternoon, so i have 3 sessions to go trough meaning i still have some time before im actually able to get the screenshots (the only way i can technically get them as soon as possible is that i would send the image on this website's discord server and copy/save the image from my current end). anyways, that's about all, see you in several hours! i might as well just <b>not show up at <i>all</i></b> if that's what you're expecting! have a good one (for now)!
