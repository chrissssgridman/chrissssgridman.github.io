    hi again! it's me, the guy who sucks at keeping their schedule consistent. i never got any fan mail to answer over the past few days due to me being extremely unpopular but i've always been like that so the feeling just really means nothing at this point. if you somehow read <a href="19-11-21.html">part 1</a> without dying of being horrendously bored, then you would know that i own the classical video game "tabletop simulator", the game where you shove things around on a digital table and try to play card games until some jerkwad decides to flip the table. the whole point of tabletop simulator is to simulate a tabletop environment. didn't see that one coming huh?? it's a damn <b>TABLE</b> what else are you gonna expect?? i remember seeing a video about it by a very obnoxiously loud youtuber from a few years ago when the game still had an older GUI, meaning i think it was still in some sort of.. early access/kickstarter phase at the time? i don't know, but it did mention there used to be a kickstarter. i suppose the project did get successfully funded, but nowadays kickstarter could be like the death sentence of a dream. but hey, if HOMESTAR RUNNER could somehow make a board game with the funding of that site much like how cards against humanity came to life, i'm sure other projects can still make it out of <i>kickstarter <b>hell</b></i>.

    a while ago, say, a few years ago, i actually had the game pirated to try it out for myself. i liked the concept, but the fact that i was always on my own kinda bored me out of my mind. i also had the steam version of btd5 given the same fate, but unlike tabletop simulator, i never actually bought the game a year later and bought btd6 instead, the more bubbly rounder third dimension version that thankfully also has co-op mode. the whole thing about tabletop simulator besides it's engine and flexibility was actually it's custom features + multiplayer rooms, great for friends. lets go forward around 2 pc resets and 2 years to where i actually had my first prepaid visa! this allowed me to buy stuff that was pirated for me originally. this included a minecraft account and a few steam games, and guess what one of them was? <b>SUPER MEAT BOY HAHAAA u got PRANK'D!!!!!!!!!!!! <i>(oh and tabletop simulator too)</i></b>. now with the power of paying and using currency to obtain goods and services like a person is <i>actually</i> supposed to do, i could actually play multiplayer rooms with people! the first thing that obviously came to mind was setting up an uno room, so i went to the steam workshop, a hub for game mods and stuff, and downloaded a good fresh copy of UNO !!!!! not the poop <i>ubicrap(soft)</i> version, the tabletop simulator version, the obviously superior version.

    time for our several hour long break again due to school schedules. when i come back, we'll talk about the actual match. a <code>*dies*</code>
    <h2>26th</h2>
    <h2>11:04 am</h2>
    new feature to blog posts now, i'm gonna have them be several day long posts until all the topics i wanted to talk about in the specific post are done with. i can't stand having blog posts be related to the same thing but are split into like, 2 to 3 parts just because im too "lazy" to continue typing about it. quick rundown on what's going on before we continue with the tabletop simulator topic, im currently attending a special presentation as part of our career class and there are like. <b>30</b> other people here im not sure what to even think about this. it's not anxiety or anything it's just like "the hell's going on who are even half of these people" because i don't know half of the peoples even in the house right now.
    <br>
    <br>
    on with tables of the top! after properly purchasing the game and getting reused to the controls again (and after stacking a tower of cards), i decided the first thing i should do is get uno on the steam workshop and host a multiplayer room with it. yeah, uno on tabletop simulator. i think it's better than ubisoft(crap) uno if i had to be honest considering it has all the rules but it's on a game that actually gets update and people <i>like</i> playing. only downside is that it technically <i>doesn't</i> have the special deck cards from rabbits, rayman, and... just dance, but that could easily be resolved manually by just making your own deck of cards or even trying to script it lol. i can't say i know how to script stuff in tabletop simulator because i actually haven't done that sort of thing before. does it use a specific programming language or it's own programming language? we may never know. anyways, once i had everything up and running, i waited for someone to join in ont he tun o party. while i waited, i remembered that there was a tablet item that allowed me to access the internet and websites in-game. i tried getting youtube to run on the thing, but the videos like to keep spitting out html5 errors which didn't let me watch much videos. <i>however</i>, the thing DID like to support flash. i don't know why it likes to do that but it just does!
    <br>
    <br>
    after some time, i put a lo-fi 24/7 stream on (the one shown below) and silently waited for someone to join in. eventually, someone did! this is actually a rather <b>large</b> turn-around in what i was expecting to happen. i expected that literally no one would come and i would before bored enough to not keep the room up and leave myself. we both played a round or so before 2 more people joined in. now remember this, the room can seat up to 8 players, so we already took up 4 of the 8 slots. this was when the game started to get <b>R E A L .</b> the regular deck of uno cards was all we needed in order to have fun, y'know! due to this, this allowed the game to last much longer since there's a higher chance of the tables being turned.

    <br>
    there's something i also wanted to mention with the game that we didn't do, the 0 and 7 card rules!
    <ul>
        <li><b>0 rule</b>: once played, everyone switches their hand to the next player based on the turn order, which can either be clockwise or counter-clockwise</li>
        <li><b>7 rule</b>: once played, player can choose any other hand from someone else to switch with.</li>
    </ul>
    back when i used to play the ubisoft uno on both my xbox and then my nintendo switch, the 7 and 0 rules were what made each match (with the cpu players) much longer than they should've been. i'm not sure how these rules were included with the game but they were marked as optional in the game anyways so i guess that's rather interesting to know! the reason why we never did this in the tabletop simulator uno is actually something that i forgot about. i don't remember if it was a regular deck of uno cards that we moved around or it was all scripted meaning some processes were done automatically. now that i think about it, im pretty sure it was a manual deck of uno cards that had no scripting to them. either way, i'm glad we had fun with it back then!
    <br>
    <br>
    some time later, i set up a stopwatch object on the table and thought that we could have the "world's longest uno game", since this was taking a while. we went through several people saying "uno!" yet we always found out a way to give them more cards before they could play their personal exodius on all of us. stuff like this kept the game interesting. as time went on, we only further suspected on who might pull the next trick out of their sleeve.
    <h2>12:02 pm</h2>
    yeah i know stuff's about to get interesting and i still haven't described the whole vr man thing like in the title, but i have to go now, the morning's almost over! no worries, i <i>do</i> have a CDLI class during the afternoon at 2 PM so i could discuss the even JUICER stuff during that. alright <i>byeeeeeEEEE (AGAIN)</i>
