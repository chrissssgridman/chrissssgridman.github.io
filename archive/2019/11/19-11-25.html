    hi again! it's me, the guy who sucks at keeping their schedule consistent. i never got any fan mail to answer over the past few days due to me being extremely unpopular but i've always been like that so the feeling just really means nothing at this point. if you somehow read <a href="19-11-21.html">part 1</a> without dying of being horrendously bored, then you would know that i own the classical video game "tabletop simulator", the game where you shove things around on a digital table and try to play card games until some jerkwad decides to flip the table. the whole point of tabletop simulator is to simulate a tabletop environment. didn't see that one coming huh?? it's a damn <b>TABLE</b> what else are you gonna expect?? i remember seeing a video about it by a very obnoxiously loud youtuber from a few years ago when the game still had an older GUI, meaning i think it was still in some sort of.. early access/kickstarter phase at the time? i don't know, but it did mention there used to be a kickstarter. i suppose the project did get successfully funded, but nowadays kickstarter could be like the death sentence of a dream. but hey, if HOMESTAR RUNNER could somehow make a board game with the funding of that site much like how cards against humanity came to life, i'm sure other projects can still make it out of <i>kickstarter <b>hell</b></i>.

    a while ago, say, a few years ago, i actually had the game pirated to try it out for myself. i liked the concept, but the fact that i was always on my own kinda bored me out of my mind. i also had the steam version of btd5 given the same fate, but unlike tabletop simulator, i never actually bought the game a year later and bought btd6 instead, the more bubbly rounder third dimension version that thankfully also has co-op mode. the whole thing about tabletop simulator besides it's engine and flexibility was actually it's custom features + multiplayer rooms, great for friends. lets go forward around 2 pc resets and 2 years to where i actually had my first prepaid visa! this allowed me to buy stuff that was pirated for me originally. this included a minecraft account and a few steam games, and guess what one of them was? <b>SUPER MEAT BOY HAHAAA u got PRANK'D!!!!!!!!!!!! <i>(oh and tabletop simulator too)</i></b>. now with the power of paying and using currency to obtain goods and services like a person is <i>actually</i> supposed to do, i could actually play multiplayer rooms with people! the first thing that obviously came to mind was setting up an uno room, so i went to the steam workshop, a hub for game mods and stuff, and downloaded a good fresh copy of UNO !!!!! not the poop <i>ubicrap(soft)</i> version, the tabletop simulator version, the obviously superior version.
