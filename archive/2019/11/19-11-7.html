    <h1>day before the long weekend something something</h1>
    <h2>9:59 pm</h2>
    hello once again! i'm rust while in school, and today's none other than a pretty good day, if i do say so my do say so myself (iidssmdssm). you wanna know <i>why</i> im feeling this rather positive on a mere THURSDAY???? (wait it's not FRIDAY what????????? IMPOSSIBLE) well, today's none other than the day before the long weekend. in memory of remembrance day, newfoundland schools (including mine <i>and</i> cdli courses) will be closing on friday and monday, which is always pretty cool and good! you know, times like these always remind me of the fact that <b>2019 is almost over</b>! can you BELIEVE it?? it's already been 11 months and we've seen so much new, <code>horrifying</code> stuff for the year. i've had a lot of experiences during the time of 2019, and i've come to appreciate everything that i've been through.
    <br>
    <br>
    enough beating around the bush for now, what i'm here to discuss today is what remembrance day is and whatsa going on, and then it's free sailing from here. <b>remembrance day</b> is a national yearly holiday on the 11th of november dedicated to all of the soldiers who bloody <i>died</i> during the amazingly gruesome event that we call world war 2.
    <p class="boxed">footnote: one day, we'll have a world war 3 that'll be entirely on twitter. i hate to be the BOOMER saying that but hey i'd be down for an online world war if we ever decide to get one of those someday.</p>
    world war 2 being.. not really good, to the point where even the board game monopoly had to get itself it's own world war 2 version. families were horrified and upset, and people born after world war 2 probably wouldn't even understand a single thing about it. y'know, until the school makes them learn about it during history or social studies, <i>but my point still stands on the matter</i>.
    <h2>10:17 am</h2>
    so the current assignment im working on as of right now before i have to go for recess (and then <b>french</b>, ugh) and then social studies and <b>ENGLISH</b> (ugh i hate that too man no wonder the evil dude in homestuck is named "english" they're both annoying DOUCHEBAGS!!!!!), but after <i>all</i> of that, i'll be free for FOUR DAYS!! which is KINDA COOL!! here's the questions that i'll be dealing with, feel free to answer them yourself and put it in the comment section if you want to bother with social questions from a career class.
