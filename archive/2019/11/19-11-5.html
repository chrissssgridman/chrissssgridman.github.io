            hey all, rust here and wait am i typing this post during school hours?!??? yep, your boy was able to somehow do an epic hacker gamer move and get visual studio code (and portablegit) running on the school computer that i use for cdli courses. pretty cool, don't you think? now, i <i>am</i> using these powers respectively and only doing typing stuff during school hours when i got some free time to do whatever and the such, and today's just gonna be a bunch of presentations anyways so i don't really see why i have to be worried about it for now.
            <br>
            <br>
            for the people who don't know, cdli is something new that's been happening with newfoundland schools if you call new a few years old, while newfoundland is over 300 years old. here's the quick rundown, cdli courses are essentially online versions of pre-existing courses, which is actually pretty cool. now i can experience the wonders of social studies on the laptop while doing something else on the other side. learning while having fun. probably one of the most rarest things you'll ever experience that isn't another nintendo edutainment game for the SNES. kinda weird how that's just really even a thing at all. mario teaches typing 2 for sure, i hope you all remember our lord and saviour, mario head, from the nintendo computer game called mario teaches typing 2.
        <h2>2:50 pm</h2>
            but now it's time for me to go kids, the bell is almost at 3:00 indicating that i have to go home by that time. rust_ away! vroooooooooooooooooooooom.
