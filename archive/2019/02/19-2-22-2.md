## Ditto Highlights 1 - Yuuko holds an AK-47 while Strong Bad enters the 5th dimension.

Now for something new. Introducing, Ditto Highlights, a not-streamlined series of posts where I share epic gamer images from my Ditto clipboard manager. Each post will contain 10 images, more or less. Depends on how much fresh content was cooking up in there.

For people who're confusing this with the Ditto Pokemon, the program is actually a pretty good clipboard manager which keeps track of everything that you've ever copied. It can get pretty big, and chock-full of junk you never knew existed.

My personal favorite is either Strong Bad in the 5th dimension or Yuuko shooting an AK-47.
