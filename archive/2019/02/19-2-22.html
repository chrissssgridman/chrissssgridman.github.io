<p>Hi, it's me, funny man. I've decided to move from my GitHub Pages site to a <em>Blogger</em> site for better optimization and proper organization.</p>

<p>I'll be posting development updates, funny things, clipboard highlights, and whatever else on Blogger, so feel free to move from refreshing the GitHub Pages site to just using RSS or whatever on this blog. Have fun, and don't explode.</p>

<p>A new feature from the original blog is the introduction of commenting! Now you can share your weird thoughts with the world! Real revolutions are being made, folks. Real revolutions.</p>

<p>Anywho, for the time being, I'll post the original archive posts here so you can just check here to read the original posts from the GitHub Pages site. I probably won't actually get around to it, so don't look for that anytime soon.</p>

<p>No, there won't be a Discord server for this blog. Just add me on Discord. <strong>rust_#0051</strong></p>
