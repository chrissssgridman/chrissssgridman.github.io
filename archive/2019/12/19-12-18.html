<h1>commit sudoku wahoo off the empire state building</h1>
<h2>9:52 am</h2>
<p>hi it's me rust and <b>OH GOD FUCK I HAVE A SCIENCE TEST TODAY</b>. to be honest, it's not really <i>that</i> much to worry about?! maybe?? i dunno man i'm just freaking about the whole thing if i had to be honest. i've been scrambling to write important notes on my periodic table that i'll be tested on. additionally, it's social studies and i got thrown at with another fucking assignment. hooray. all of this CDLI malarkey has been the sole reason for me delaying the block for an extra <b>four fucking days</b>. times like these i wonder if death is ever going to become one of those "valid options", but like, no. that's just stupid. like god man i don't give a flying fuck about democracy?? do you expect me to become the god damn <i>p e s i d e n t ? !</i> because any decision i DO make gets phased out eventually anyways. might as well wait until spencer finds out where i live and bashes my fucking head against the corner of a table until my face isn't even looking like a face and more like a watermelon when you smack it with a shovel several times. but enough of me thinking about this sort of thing, now lets talk about something else. <b>the new website header</b>! yeah that's right you SUSA POOPS! while you were waiting for <a href="19-12-4.html">the last bloody post</a> to be completed after several game reviews, i was also giving the site a brand new coat of header paint. now that i use a header.html embed, i can still technically use the iframe header but it'll update on everything! the downside is that due to weird centering, the header is actually <b>1258px</b> when the main content <code>div</code> tag is actually <b>1250px</b>. for some people, this would throw their OCD off the fucking charts and also proceed to slam my head against the corner of the table.</p>
<p>the new header was supposed to make the site work slightly more natively with scrips alone, but it may fluctuate depending on browsers. firefox likes to handle tables by giving them different shades for table borders while chrome likes to give it the no shade treatment, which i want more than shaded. but, i mean, <i>shaded</i> works fine too! the additional upside of using the brand new html header is that i can now update the news ticker and last updated date right in visual studio code instead of having to run adobe animate every single time. the even <i>better</i> upside is that clicking on one of the home buttons on the header now no longer forces the browser you're on to open a new tab. take that, bandwidth! man, we've come a long way since we used to have this whole thing running entirely on markdown documents. now we have this fancy theme, a new header, custom fonts, and everything's hosted on github! man i just feel <i>GREAT</i> about this to be honest! i've heard about these ".php" file formats but i haven't figured out what they are yet. however, i don't have plans to figure those out. probably just some more advanced version of html anyways. right, anyways, this entire post was just for me to tell you that i'm still not exactly dead with writing my posts. it devolved into me doing it mostly daily... <i>mostly</i>, during cdli classes when i have the time to do such thing.</p>
<p>i guess the first topic i could talk about today could just start with a few new stuff that happened earlier last night and the night before. so the day before i got into this new one of those "essential" games called sudoku. sudoku is sorta like solitaire in relation to how both games have functions based on logic, and not something like chance <small>(POKER. angry noises. i hate poker !!!!!!!!!)</small></p>
<center><img src="../../../images/blog/2019/12/sudoku.png" width="50%"></center>
<p>the logical rules in sudoku (that of which you can play <a href="https://sudoku.com/">here</a> explain that every number in each row and column must be unique. that means every row should have numbers 1 through 9 without occurring more than once. the same goes for the columns. that's where the whole thing comes into play, y'know? there's not much else to it besides that. after trying out sudoku for a few minutes, i asked <b>emma</b> (a friend of mine from the r/nichijou server) if she wanted to play checkers or something instead. no, wait. that was <i>before</i> i got into sudoku. look whatever the time's not important! alright let me refresh. after me and emma did some checkers and whatnot in tabletop simulator, i found out about sudoku and gave it more of a fair shot than last time.</p>
<p>tabletop simulator, if you remember it from some time ago (if not, you can catch up on it <a href="../11/19-11-25.html">here</a>) is a game that does it's best to digitally emulate a table that you can do stuff on. stuff like playing board games! recently i found out that the one homestar runner board game that exists (trogdor!! the board game) actually has a workshop mod for the game. however, i never got the time to play it with emma. all we really did at first was play checkers. however, it seemed that we were evenly matched as we sorta reached a <i>stalemate</i> and we couldn't exactly get the other to open up and get some kills. killing counters. yeah, that's how checker works. you stomp on your unsuspecting enemies and try to wipe out all of them as soon as possible. it got boring after one match, so we tried the more complicated chinese version called "chinese checkers", but even <i>then</i>, we got bored of it. then, i had one of those epic 100 IQ MOVE MOVEMENTS (supposedly) and decided that we should do some <b>JIGSAW PUZZLES BABEY !!!!!! woo yeah B)</b>.</p>
<h2>10:45 am</h2>
<p>oh dear, almost time for recess. the next cdli class i have is the science test and all the other 2 classes i have for the day aren't cdli classes, so i won't be able to do <i>anything</i> blog related until after 3 pm. maybe. no promises. anyways yeah bye!</p>
<h2>1:54 pm</h2>
<p>hi quick update! so i got my science test all done (surpisingly) and now i'm currently just waiting it out until we do life skills after. i've been told that we'll be doing concert practice during this time again, so i won't have any chances to update the post for the whole subject. after all of that, i'll continue the post when i get back. in the meantime, have today's post's irregular <b>song of the day!</b> anyways yeah to summarize: test's done, doing concert practice, will continue with tabletop and whatever else when i get back. bye!</p>
