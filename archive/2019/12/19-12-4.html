        hi it's me rust im watching touhou characters play slender, the game where y'gotta find those <b>8 rather comedic pages</b> before the guy with the extra arms (i am VERY JEALOUS!!!!!!!!!!!) gets you in a very mediocre game of hide and seek. look if i wanna play something scary i'd play <i>mineshaftcrapcraft</i>, the <big>ULTIMATE</big> fitness training program that anyone can play. steering wheel controller supported too. that's a thing. yes. <i>i saw it happen</i>. i just wrote that whole chunk of text under the footer. damn, and i haven't even been drinking <b>nonalcoholic drinks</b> as of, well, <i>ever</i>. like i'll be real here how come you can feel the same as drunk but not really with different drinks? i don't understand man, i just don't recall. anyways, if you're not <b>somewhat blind</b>, you would know that im talking about my visa gift card today and then the stuff i was gonna talk about <a href="19-12-2.html">2 days ago</a> from now, that of which due to me being <b>horrendously lazy</b>. half of the time was me doing nothing and also working on some project before i go deal with math again, so i haven't been able to type little to anything for the past hour on this post. <i>so...</i> um. have this for the next hour or so before social studies starts up after recess! reimu and marisa on the laptop, what r they doing ?????????? <b>YOU</b> tell <b>ME</b>!!!!!!!!!!!
