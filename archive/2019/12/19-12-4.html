        hi it's me rust im watching touhou characters play slender, the game where y'gotta find those <b>8 rather comedic pages</b> before the guy with the extra arms (i am VERY JEALOUS!!!!!!!!!!!) gets you in a very mediocre game of hide and seek. look if i wanna play something scary i'd play <i>mineshaftcrapcraft</i>, the <big>ULTIMATE</big> fitness training program that anyone can play. steering wheel controller supported too. that's a thing. yes. <i>i saw it happen</i>. i just wrote that whole chunk of text under the footer. damn, and i haven't even been drinking <b>nonalcoholic drinks</b> as of, well, <i>ever</i>. like i'll be real here how come you can feel the same as drunk but not really with different drinks? i don't understand man, i just don't recall. anyways, if you're not <b>somewhat blind</b>, you would know that im talking about my visa gift card today and then the stuff i was gonna talk about <a href="19-12-2.html">2 days ago</a> from now, that of which due to me being <b>horrendously lazy</b>. half of the time was me doing nothing and also working on some project before i go deal with math again, so i haven't been able to type little to anything for the past hour on this post. <i>so...</i> um. have this for the next hour or so before social studies starts up after recess! reimu and marisa on the laptop, what r they doing ?????????? <b>YOU</b> tell <b>ME</b>!!!!!!!!!!!

        <h2>9:40 am</h2>
        and there's the time. off i go! then we talk visa gift cards at 11:00 am or some shit.
        <h2>11:09 am</h2>
        <p class="footnote">footnote: at this point, i'm finally using the <code>p</code> tag in order to have paragraphs, and not using the <code>br</code> tag constantly. that's gonna save me some lines i'll be honest with you there.</p>
        <p>i have returned! turns out i was having french, not math. man am i even <i>blinder</i> or what?! well, let's just begin with the current topic before we continue with the one from last post. cut to a week or two ago, i remembered that my spongebob reusable bank (yes, i have one of those. <b>yes, it exists</b>.) actually existed with money in it, with around $220 dollars (IN DOLLAR BILLS ALONE) worth in money, and that the <i>post office</i> in my town might, <big>MIGHT</big> include some gift cards that i always thought i could only get by ordering them online or going all the way to walmart (2 day trip (sometimes more)), the other option to be just being lucky in a school draw, but the only interesting ones that the school <i>does</i> have is just one of those itunes gift cards. but hey, i can buy <i>robux</i> with that type of money, so i'll give it a pass! anyways, after i recounted all of the money, put it in my wallet, and head out to the post office after around 12 minutes of walking from home to the other building. once i arrived, i decided to order a $60 visa, paid the (small) fee, got the card, and went back home. this allowed me to scratch off a <i>lot</i> of games originally on my wishlist. those being:
            <ul>
                <li>portal</li>
                <li>portal 2</li>
                <li>bejeweled 3</li>
                <li>ballisticng soundtrack</li>
                <li>baba is you</li>
                <li>marble it up</li>
            </ul>
        one of those aren't even a game, but it's not like that really matters because i want to support vonsnake with his game anyways! you know, i would've expected this whole thing to last a bit longer on how i actually got the visa, but it appears i was able to explain it in less then two parts this time. <i>w o w !</i> i was lucky during this time, most of these games were actually on autumn sale. portal 1 and 2 were in a bundle for <b><i>$1.70</i></b> man! A DOLLAR AND SEVENTY CENTS! THAT'S A <big>STEAL</big> of a <big><big>DEAL!</big></big> <small>(also i figured out that i can stack big and small tags to change the size of text even more, which is pretty cool.)</small> <small><small>(look see im incredibly small! wah!)</small></small> alright, that's enough fooling around with the small and big tags. next time it's just gonna be some cars racing around with the marquee tag.
        <br>
        <marquee behavior="alternate"; scrollamount="15">i mean, who could pass up the usage of this tag? this is just fun man lol</marquee>
        <br>
        that aside again, if i were at home right now at not at school, i would've taken the time to give each game it's own review, but i'm currently in the <code>rather comedic school building</code> and the only cdli class i have during the afternoon is science, which is just right now a confusing pile of everything. compounds, assignments, portfolio(??????????), it's just incredibly hard for me to deal with. before that, i got english in which i continue working on the custom cover for my book, which is our final assignment for the book out of a few other choices. <i>one of them</i> was that you had to compose a song dedicated to the book. hell, im pretty sure the book in question, <b>lord of the flies</b>, was also mentioned by cgp grey at one time, the guy who drove across the loneliest road in america with a <b>tesla</b> of all things. the guy's pretty talented in both that <i>and</i> talking about some forms of history. i'd say something additional but i forgot what i was going to say originally.
        </p>
        <h2>12:01 pm</h2>
        <p>oh, the time's faster than me it seems. looks like i'll have to delay posting yet again and then start the several game review with i can. in regards to objectbloxia additionally, there's still the extra characters i need to go over ugh! might have to delay it until 3 pm or if i somehow have any additional time during 2 pm. off i go again! <i>ok bye!</i></p>
        <h1>5th</h1>
        <h2>11:35 am</h2>
        <p>ugh yeah this happens. i'm still at school so i won't be able to have any in-depth game reviews yet, only when i get back home. however, i will say that it'll start with the simple games and we'll increasingly get into the other stuff. just call this the review spectacular! reviewtactular. um. yeah, that'll probably be a good reason for me to change the title from <i>"power of the rather comedic visa gift card"</i> to something new that includes all of the topics, like i used to name stuff far earlier. how about <i>"ballistic baba marble bejeweled it up is you 3ng++ reviewtactular not sponsored by visa"</i>? ooh, that's a good one. i'll try that. note that the games will most certainly not be in order from the title itself, but rather on how long i may suspect the review itself is going to be. i think my last review was on the khonjin house movie or something from long ago. <a href="../../2018/09/18-9-9.html">oh yeah this post!</a> it was movie review 001. best i rename that now to just thingy review-y 002. that'd be cool. least i'll make use of it again after over a year! man i bet like at least one of you peoples are excited for these <b>Relevating Relevations</b>! aAha. ha. i got some time, not sure what i should do before i close off the post for another some period of time. um.
        <br>

        </p>
        <h2>11:55 am</h2>
        <p>yeah, i should probably go and get going now before i get late to go home. <small><small>(my dad comes home tomorrow and im having mixed feeling about it.)</small></small> i got french and social studies later (im doing good at social studies and french is doing just fine... i guess?) so i'll see you guys at 2 pm and see what i can do with what i currently got. bye!</p>
