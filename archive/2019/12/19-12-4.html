        <h2>9:10 am</h2>
        <p>hi it's me rust im watching touhou characters play slender, the game where y'gotta find those <b>8 rather comedic pages</b> before the guy with the extra arms (i am VERY JEALOUS!!!!!!!!!!!) gets you in a very mediocre game of hide and seek. look if i wanna play something scary i'd play <i>mineshaftcrapcraft</i>, the <big>ULTIMATE</big> fitness training program that anyone can play. steering wheel controller supported too. that's a thing. yes. <i>i saw it happen</i>. i just wrote that whole chunk of text under the footer. damn, and i haven't even been drinking <b>nonalcoholic drinks</b> as of, well, <i>ever</i>. like i'll be real here how come you can feel the same as drunk but not really with different drinks? i don't understand man, i just don't recall. anyways, if you're not <b>somewhat blind</b>, you would know that im talking about my visa gift card today and then the stuff i was gonna talk about <a href="19-12-2.html">2 days ago</a> from now, that of which due to me being <b>horrendously lazy</b>. half of the time was me doing nothing and also working on some project before i go deal with math again, so i haven't been able to type little to anything for the past hour on this post. <i>so...</i> um. have this for the next hour or so before social studies starts up after recess! reimu and marisa on the laptop, what r they doing ?????????? <b>YOU</b> tell <b>ME</b>!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
        <center><img src="../../../images/blog/2019/12/them.png"></center>
        <h2>9:40 am</h2>
        and there's the time. off i go! then we talk visa gift cards at 11:00 am or some shit.
        <h2>11:09 am</h2>
        <p class="footnote">footnote: at this point, i'm finally using the <code>p</code> tag in order to have paragraphs, and not using the <code>br</code> tag constantly. that's gonna save me some lines i'll be honest with you there.</p>
        <p class="boxed">update: everything has the p tag now B)</p>
        <p>i have returned! turns out i was having french, not math. man am i even <i>blinder</i> or what?! well, let's just begin with the current topic before we continue with the one from last post. cut to a week or two ago, i remembered that my spongebob reusable bank (yes, i have one of those. <b>yes, it exists</b>.) actually existed with money in it, with around $220 dollars (IN DOLLAR BILLS ALONE) worth in money, and that the <i>post office</i> in my town might, <big>MIGHT</big> include some gift cards that i always thought i could only get by ordering them online or going all the way to walmart (2 day trip (sometimes more)), the other option to be just being lucky in a school draw, but the only interesting ones that the school <i>does</i> have is just one of those itunes gift cards. but hey, i can buy <i>robux</i> with that type of money, so i'll give it a pass! anyways, after i recounted all of the money, put it in my wallet, and head out to the post office after around 12 minutes of walking from home to the other building. once i arrived, i decided to order a $60 visa, paid the (small) fee, got the card, and went back home. this allowed me to scratch off a <i>lot</i> of games originally on my wishlist. those being:
            <ul>
                <li>portal (bundled)</li>
                <li>portal 2 (bundled)</li>
                <li>bejeweled 3</li>
                <li>ballisticng soundtrack</li>
                <li>baba is you</li>
                <li>marble it up</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>one of those aren't even a game, but it's not like that really matters because i want to support vonsnake with his game anyways! you know, i would've expected this whole thing to last a bit longer on how i actually got the visa, but it appears i was able to explain it in less then two parts this time. <i>w o w !</i> i was lucky during this time, most of these games were actually on autumn sale. portal 1 and 2 were in a bundle for <b><i>$1.70</i></b> man! A DOLLAR AND SEVENTY CENTS! THAT'S A <big>STEAL</big> of a <big><big>DEAL!</big></big> <small>(also i figured out that i can stack big and small tags to change the size of text even more, which is pretty cool.)</small> <small><small>(look see im incredibly small! wah!)</small></small> alright, that's enough fooling around with the small and big tags. next time it's just gonna be some cars racing around with the marquee tag.</p>
        <marquee behavior="alternate"; scrollamount="15">i mean, who could pass up the usage of this tag? this is just fun man lol</marquee>
        <br>
        <p>that aside again, if i were at home right now at not at school, i would've taken the time to give each game it's own review, but i'm currently in the <code>rather comedic school building</code> and the only cdli class i have during the afternoon is science, which is just right now a confusing pile of everything. compounds, assignments, portfolio(??????????), it's just incredibly hard for me to deal with. before that, i got english in which i continue working on the custom cover for my book, which is our final assignment for the book out of a few other choices. <i>one of them</i> was that you had to compose a song dedicated to the book. hell, im pretty sure the book in question, <b>lord of the flies</b>, was also mentioned by cgp grey at one time, the guy who drove across the loneliest road in america with a <b>tesla</b> of all things. the guy's pretty talented in both that <i>and</i> talking about some forms of history. i'd say something additional but i forgot what i was going to say originally.</p>
        <h2>12:01 pm</h2>
        <p>oh, the time's faster than me it seems. looks like i'll have to delay posting yet again and then start the several game review with i can. in regards to objectbloxia additionally, there's still the extra characters i need to go over ugh! might have to delay it until 3 pm or if i somehow have any additional time during 2 pm. off i go again! <i>ok bye!</i></p>
        <h1>5th</h1>
        <h2>11:35 am</h2>
        <p>ugh yeah this happens. i'm still at school so i won't be able to have any in-depth game reviews yet, only when i get back home. however, i will say that it'll start with the simple games and we'll increasingly get into the other stuff. just call this the review spectacular! reviewtactular. um. yeah, that'll probably be a good reason for me to change the title from <i>"power of the rather comedic visa gift card"</i> to something new that includes all of the topics, like i used to name stuff far earlier. how about <i>"ballistic baba marble bejeweled it up is you 3ng++ reviewtactular not sponsored by visa"</i>? ooh, that's a good one. i'll try that. note that the games will most certainly not be in order from the title itself, but rather on how long i may suspect the review itself is going to be. i think my last review was on the khonjin house movie or something from long ago. <a href="../../2018/09/18-9-9.html">oh yeah this post!</a> it was movie review 001. best i rename that now to just thingy review-y 002. that'd be cool. least i'll make use of it again after over a year! man i bet like at least one of you peoples are excited for these <b>Relevating Relevations</b>! aAha. ha. i got some time, not sure what i should do before i close off the post for another some period of time. um.
        <br>

        </p>
        <h2>11:55 am</h2>
        <p>yeah, i should probably go and get going now before i get late to go home. <small><small>(my dad comes home tomorrow and im having mixed feeling about it.)</small></small> i got french and social studies later (im doing good at social studies and french is doing just fine... i guess?) so i'll see you guys at 2 pm and see what i can do with what i currently got. bye!</p>

        <h2>2:04 pm</h2>
        <p>hey happy friday! per usual, i'm incredibly late and i'm at school again while i'm typing this, meaning i can't review the games. oh no i'm not at my own pc i can't play vibeo grames!!! this is actually kinda sad my friends <b>what will we <big>DO???????</big></b> because i have no idea. the only other thing i could really talk about is pretty off topic with the whole <i>game reviewing thing</i>. like what, do you want be to review solitaire, because bloody hell if that's what i gotta do, that's what i gotta do...the internet's down anyways so even <i>if</i> i wanted to review something like the original version of n++... i really <i>can't</i>. oh well! i guess now it's time for me to review solitaire while listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/eJeeAoKkcC0">this bloody good tune</a>. i believe i heard it on that united kingdom sight reading tournament. maybe one of those, <i>wario-ware type maps</i> that i see a lot. LET'S GET STARTED WITH 002 HELL YEAH.</p>

                    <big>002 - microsoft solitaire collection</big></p>
                    <p>microsoft solitaire collection is a game made by, well, microsoft. you know, those guys! they made all your favorite classics such as minesweeper and jigsaw back during the windows xp days. well, actually, they didn't make the <i>jigsaw</i> version, they only made that when they were able to do it during windows 10, which was <i>VERY</i> late if i had to be honest. imagine if someone had to wait this long in order to actually fucking play jigsaw. even <i>tabletop simulator</i> was able to do that a few years ago when it was first still in beta on kickstarter. like come on man at least have some decency.</p>
                    <p>most obviously, the important part of solitaire is none other than klondike, which was back then, the only game of cards besides hearts (i think as of windows 7? there's also spider solitaire and all that which we'll get into later). klondike is the name for the regular solitaire. rows of cards, put em in the stock pile. i remember when the school computers all used to run <i>windows xp</i> still, but now they're all windows 10, with a few being spared to windows 7 while only one computer in the barely used science lab still runs windows xp.</p>

        <h1>9th</h1>
        <p>alright, i've fucking had <i>enough</i> of not having the games on hand to review them. i'm just gonna go and use screenshots i found <b>ELSEWHERE</b> in order to actually fuel up my game review properly. enough <big>fucking around</big>, it's time for me to review the games and then we're <b>d o n e</b> with this post. god, i spent too much time on this already. this post started on the fourth, now it's the ninth. <b>FIVE DAYS WORTH</b>. by the way! i've been cranking out some new updates with everything as of right now, and the text has been updated to be in this nice, silky smooth justified text style. now it's cleaner! yay! that's right, now you get to experience... <i>most</i> posts in glorious JUSTIFIED TEXT! man this site just gets better and better huh? more advanced articles and shit. alright, time for the next game review. here's what's on our list.</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>portal (bundled)</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>10:43 am</h2>
        <p>all we need to do now is just start off with the simplest game here that isn't microsoft solitaire. i'm thinking bejeweled 3. however, time's running short again because i was too busy screwing around with html tags and seeing if i could actually get a better header/footer going, but it seems that isn't the case. that's just great, now is it. plus, well, the only other cdli class i have after this is just science, but i swear the moment i get back i'll hopefully be able to do some good ol' fashioned game reviewing? maybe?? <b>look man this blog post needs to end eventually, if this takes up all month i don't know what i'll do</b>. just, enjoy what's there for now.</p>
