<h1>The May 5th Inaugural Post</h1>
<h2>1:00 PST</h2>
<p>Welcome to the inaugural post! It's not really an inaugural post if the thing being inaugurated is still under construction, though, is it. It's like if the World Trade Center in SF popped the champagne bottles going all "WOOOOOO! FUCK YEAH! WELCOME TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO. IT'S OFFICIALLY INAUGURATED" and the building's only half completed. Like, you're going "woo, yeah..." and feigning excitement while sort of throwing your fist celebratorily in the air while also whispering to the person next to you "what's this guy talking about..."</p>

<p>Imagine right now you shoot something into space. There's, like, no odds it ever hits anything, right? Like, MOST probably, your stuff is NOT gonna get seen by <i>anybody</i> out there. BUT there's the chance that it <i>does,</i> and that's why this is here. Like, ONE person is getting this link given to them (hi rust (thanks for the help rust)), so I hope anybody else finding this finds it through pure chance. If you did not come across this site due to pure coincidence! Please make your way to the X button at the top right of your browser and CLICK! This website is for me to plant my flag down for only the 0.00000001% to see! Buh-bye, non 0.00000001% bozos!</p>
