welcome to my own little site! this is mainly full of markdown files, so there isn't a built in *dark theme* of some sorts. for that, i'll recommend for you to use Dark Reader, a browser extension that makes every page dark. that should make things much more easier to read. (note, that doesn't work for mobile devices, sorry.)
