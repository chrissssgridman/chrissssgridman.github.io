    welcome to my personal site! it doesn't come with a dark mode. in order to view this site without melting your eyes, i suggest getting the "dark reader" extension, which is available for chrome and firefox (not sure about edge but go ahead anyways, see if it's there).

    the changelog and blog buttons have been moved to the top, but these will be replaced eventually
