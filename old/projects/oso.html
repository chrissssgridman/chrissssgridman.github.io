<b>open source objects</b> is like a multi-animator project except it's not reanimated and it's actually creating something entirely new. according to the show, open source objects is a show that anyone can work on, even you! well, maybe. they have their own sort of "quality control" so if you're one of those lazy flipaclip users then there's not really any hopes for you getting in. sorry my dude
<br>
<br>
as of right now, i've done some work in episodes 2 and 3, where i handled doing audio engineering, which is where you put the sound effects and voice clips together. i don't get to add the music but at least i had some purpose in the project. without me, it would've taken the team of organizers a whopping 12 seconds for them to find someone else!! woo!!
<br>
<br>
currently, you can still sign up to be part of the crew, but considering how things are handled, there's a chance you won't get a job for any new episodes at all because someone else was quicker to apply for it on a google form. at least we have dead corny to help suffice our woes
