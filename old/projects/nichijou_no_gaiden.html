<b>nichijou no gaiden</b> (or just <b>nng</b>, early name <b>nichijou season 2</b>) used to be one of the larger projects i was working on from last year until i eventually cancelled it in place of <a href="projects/klaust_.html">klaust_</a>, the webcomic about dreams and depression that isn't related to BFDI or the anime Nichijou.
<br>
<br>
a quick rundown, nng was supposed to be the combination of nichijou with BFDI's art style (especially during BFB, also known as it's 4th season), which i originally announced on the r/nichijou subreddit, which went downhill from there due to creative differences, drama, and also the idea not really making sense.
<br>
<br>
if there was one thing i wanted to say about nng, it would be that it helped me with creating assets properly for the first time, which allowed me to actually take the time to improve at art over the year's time i put into the project. i also published all of the show artwork, scripts, and assets over on another github repository that you might've noticed on my github profile!
<br>
<br>
i'm not working on nng anymore obviously, and i don't have any plans to "bring it back" by any means, since i'm also focusing more on other projects as of right now. however, i can share some of the art that was made for the show right here!

<h1>special thanks</h1>
i want to say thanks to people like epicbattler3 and superscratchkat for helping out with some assets during the time i worked on nng, alongside people like jitsus for helping with writing the only 2 episodes that exist. without any of you, things might've been wildly different from here. thank you for taking your time to support the project for the time it was active!
